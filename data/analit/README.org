* rbc.txt :: shape relatate quantities for equilibrium "RBC"

Columns
x, z, phi, c1, c2, H, K, laplace(H), force, nx, ny, nz

- phi :: phi: acos(z/sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2))
- c1, c2 :: curvatures
- force  :: signed force for bending energy = H^2
- n[xyz] :: noraml

see maxima/rbc/force, normals are from inside to outside --- a
curvatue of a sphere is negative.
