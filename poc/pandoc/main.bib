  abstract = {A general framework to combine numerical homogenization and reduced-order
	modelling techniques for partial differential equations (PDEs) with
	multiple scales is described. Numerical homogenization methods are
	usually efficient to approximate the effective solution of PDEs with
	multiple scales. However, classical numerical homogenization techniques
	require the numerical solution of a large number of so-called microproblems
	to approximate the effective data at selected grid points of the
	computational domain. Such computations become particularly expensive
	for high-dimensional, time-dependent or nonlinear problems. In this
	paper, we explain how numerical homogenization method can benefit
	from reduced-order modelling techniques that allow one to identify
	offline and online computational procedures. The effective data are
	only computed accurately at a carefully selected number of grid points
	(offline stage) appropriately ‘interpolated’ in the online stage
	resulting in an online cost comparable to that of a single-scale
	solver. The methodology is presented for a class of PDEs with multiple
	scales, including elliptic, parabolic, wave and nonlinear problems.
	Numerical examples, including wave propagation in inhomogeneous media
	and solute transport in unsaturated porous media, illustrate the
	proposed method.},

  journal  = {Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences},

  abstract = {We show how to apply the method of temperature-accelerated molecular
	dynamics (TAMD) in collective variables [Maragliano L, Vanden-Eijnden
	E (2006)Chem Phys Lett 426:168–175] to sample the conformational
	space of multidomain proteins in all-atom, explicitly solvated molecular
	dynamics simulations. The method allows the system to hyperthermally
	explore the free-energy surface in a set of collective variables
	computed at the physical temperature. As collective variables, we
	pick Cartesian coordinates of centers of contiguous subdomains. The
	method is applied to the GroEL subunit, a 55-kDa, three-domain protein,
	and HIV-1 gp120. For GroEL, the method induces in about 40 ns conformational
	changes that recapitulate the t → r′′ transition and are not observed
	in unaccelerated molecular dynamics: The apical domain is displaced
	by 30 Å, with a twist of 90° relative to the equatorial domain, and
	the root-mean-squared deviation relative to the r′′ conformer is
	reduced from 13 to 5 Å, representing fairly high predictive capability.
	For gp120, the method predicts both counterrotation of inner and
	outer domains and disruption of the so-called bridging sheet. In
	particular, TAMD on gp120 initially in the CD4-bound conformation
	visits conformations that deviate by 3.6 Å from the gp120 conformer
	in complex with antibody F105, again reflecting good predictive capability.
	TAMD generates plausible all-atom models of the so-far structurally
	uncharacterized unliganded conformation of HIV-1 gp120, which may
	prove useful in the development of inhibitors and immunogens. The
	fictitious temperature employed also gives a rough estimate of 10
	kcal/mol for the free-energy barrier between conformers in both cases.},

	in the field of molecular simulation and, as a consequence, did not
	play a role in the development of open system molecular simulation
	techniques, even though it can provide the conceptual legitimation
	of simulation techniques that mimic open systems. We shall demonstrate
	that the model can serve as a tool in devising both numerical procedures
	and conceptual definitions of physical quantities that cannot be
	defined in a straightforward way by systems with a fixed number of
	molecules. In particular, we discuss the utility of the Bergmann–Lebowitz
	(BL) model for the calculation of equilibrium time correlation functions
	within the grand canonical adaptive resolution method (GC-AdResS)
	and report numerical results for the case of liquid water.},

  abstract = {A velocity boundary condition for the lattice Boltzmann simulation
	technique has been proposed recently by Hecht and Harting (2008 arXiv:
	0811.4593 [http://arxiv.org/abs/0811.4593] ). This boundary condition
	is independent of the relaxation process during collision and contains
	no artificial slip. In this work, this boundary condition is extended
	to simulate slip flows. The extended boundary condition has been
	tested and it is found that the slip length is independent of the
	shear rate and the density, and proportional to the BGK relaxation
	time. The method is used to study slip in Poiseuille flow and in
	linear shear flow. Patterned walls with stripes of different slip
	parameters are also studied, and an anisotropy of the slip length
	in accordance with the surface pattern is found. The angle dependence
	of the simulation results perfectly agrees with theoretical expectations.
	The results confirm that the proposed boundary conditions can be
	used for simulating slip flows in microfluidics using the single-relaxation-time
	lattice Boltzmann technique, without any numerical slip, giving an
	accuracy of second order.},

	Spatially adaptive stochastic numerical methods are developed for

	with curved boundaries. A key issue addressed by the methods is the

	Methods are also introduced for the efficient generation of the required

	biological model for microorganism direction sensing based on concentration
	gradients. Also investigated, a mechanism for spatial pattern formation

  abstract = {In modeling many biological systems, it is important to take into
	account flexible structures which interact with a fluid. At the length
	scale of cells and cell organelles, thermal fluctuations of the aqueous
	environment become significant. In this work, it is shown how the
	immersed boundary method of [C.S. Peskin, The immersed boundary method,
	Acta Num. 11 (2002) 1–39.] for modeling flexible structures immersed
	in a fluid can be extended to include thermal fluctuations. A stochastic
	numerical method is proposed which deals with stiffness in the system
	of equations by handling systematically the statistical contributions
	of the fastest dynamics of the fluid and immersed structures over
	long time steps. An important feature of the numerical method is
	that time steps can be taken in which the degrees of freedom of the
	fluid are completely underresolved, partially resolved, or fully
	resolved while retaining a good level of accuracy. Error estimates
	in each of these regimes are given for the method. A number of theoretical
	and numerical checks are furthermore performed to assess its physical
	fidelity. For a conservative force, the method is found to simulate
	particles with the correct Boltzmann equilibrium statistics. It is
	shown in three dimensions that the diffusion of immersed particles
	simulated with the method has the correct scaling in the physical
	parameters. The method is also shown to reproduce a well-known hydrodynamic
	effect of a Brownian particle in which the velocity autocorrelation
	function exhibits an algebraic (τ−3/2) decay for long times [B.J.
	Alder, T.E. Wainwright, Decay of the Velocity Autocorrelation Function,
	Phys. Rev. A 1(1) (1970) 18–21]. A few preliminary results are presented
	for more complex systems which demonstrate some potential application
	areas of the method. Specifically, we present simulations of osmotic
	effects of molecular dimers, worm-like chain polymer knots, and a
	basic model of a molecular motor immersed in fluid subject to a hydrodynamic
	load force. The theoretical analysis and numerical results show that
	the immersed boundary method with thermal fluctuations captures many

  abstract  = {Electrons inside a conductor are often described as flowing in response
	to an electric field. This flow rarely resembles anything like the
	familiar flow of water through a pipe, but three groups describe
	counterexamples (see the Perspective by Zaanen). Moll et al. found
	that the viscosity of the electron fluid in thin wires of PdCoO2
	had a major effect on the flow, much like what happens in regular
	fluids. Bandurin et al. found evidence in graphene of electron whirlpools
	similar to those formed by viscous fluid flowing through a small
	opening. Finally, Crossno et al. observed a huge increase of thermal
	transport in graphene, a signature of so-called Dirac fluids.Science,
	this issue p. 1061, 1055, 1058; see also p. 1026Graphene hosts a
	unique electron system in which electron-phonon scattering is extremely
	weak but electron-electron collisions are sufficiently frequent to
	provide local equilibrium above the temperature of liquid nitrogen.
	Under these conditions, electrons can behave as a viscous liquid
	and exhibit hydrodynamic phenomena similar to classical liquids.
	Here we report strong evidence for this transport regime. We found
	that doped graphene exhibits an anomalous (negative) voltage drop
	near current-injection contacts, which is attributed to the formation
	of submicrometer-size whirlpools in the electron flow. The viscosity
	of graphene{\textquoteright}s electron liquid is found to be ~0.1
	square meters per second, an order of magnitude higher than that
	of honey, in agreement with many-body theory. Our work demonstrates
	the possibility of studying electron hydrodynamics using high-quality
	graphene.},

	quantities of the system. The predicted behaviour is in very good

  abstract  = {Living systems clearly operate out of thermodynamic equilibrium at
	the molecular scale. How these activities are manifest at the cellular
	scale, however, has been unclear. Battle et al. use video microscopy
	together with statistical thermodynamics to unambiguously identify
	which random fluctuations at the cellular scale are out of equilibrium
	(see the Perspective by Rupprecht and Prost). Transitions between
	states obey a detailed balance in equilibrium, whereas imbalanced
	transitions point to non-equilibrium dynamics. For instance, non-equilibrium
	dynamics can be identified in the periodic beating of a flagellum
	and in the nonperiodic fluctuations of primary cilia.Science, this
	issue p. 604; see also p. 514Systems in thermodynamic equilibrium
	are not only characterized by time-independent macroscopic properties,
	but also satisfy the principle of detailed balance in the transitions
	between microscopic configurations. Living systems function out of
	equilibrium and are characterized by directed fluxes through chemical
	states, which violate detailed balance at the molecular scale. Here
	we introduce a method to probe for broken detailed balance and demonstrate
	how such nonequilibrium dynamics are manifest at the mesosopic scale.
	The periodic beating of an isolated flagellum from Chlamydomonas
	reinhardtii exhibits probability flux in the phase space of shapes.
	With a model, we show how the breaking of detailed balance can also
	be quantified in stationary, nonequilibrium stochastic systems in
	the absence of periodic motion. We further demonstrate such broken
	detailed balance in the nonperiodic fluctuations of primary cilia
	of epithelial cells. Our analysis provides a general tool to identify
	nonequilibrium dynamics in cells and tissues.},

  abstract = {One hundred years after Einstein modelled Brownian motion, a central
	aspect of this motion in incompressible fluids has not been verified
	experimentally: the thermal noise that drives the Brownian particle,
	is not white, as in Einstein's simple theory. It is slightly coloured,
	due to hydrodynamics and the fluctuation–dissipation theorem. This
	theoretical result from the 1970s was prompted by computer simulation
	results in apparent violation of Einstein's theory. We discuss how
	a direct experimental observation of this colour might be carried
	out by using optical tweezers to separate the thermal noise from
	the particle's dynamic response to it. Since the thermal noise is
	almost white, very good statistics is necessary to resolve its colour.
	That requires stable equipment and long recording times, possibly
	making this experiment one for the future only. We give results for
	experimental requirements and for stochastic errors as functions
	of experimental window and measurement time, and discuss some potential
	sources of systematic errors.},

	Our multiscale approach concurrently couples the atomistic and coarse-grained
	models of the aqueous NaCl, where water molecules and ions change
	their resolution while moving from one resolution domain to the other.
	We employ standard extended simple point charge (SPC/E) and simple
	point charge (SPC) water models in combination with AMBER and GROMOS
	force fields for ion interactions in the atomistic domain. Electrostatics
	in our model are described by the generalized reaction field method.
	The effective interactions for water–water and water–ion interactions
	in the coarse-grained model are derived using structure-based coarse-graining
	approach while the Coulomb interactions between ions are appropriately
	screened. To ensure an even distribution of water molecules and ions
	across the simulation box we employ thermodynamic forces. We demonstrate
	that the equilibrium structural, e.g. radial distribution functions
	and density distributions of all the species, and dynamical properties
	are correctly reproduced by our adaptive resolution method. Our multiscale
	approach, which is general and can be used for any classical non-polarizable
	force-field and/or types of ions, will significantly speed up biomolecular
	simulation involving aqueous salt.},

  number = {{4}},
  abstract = {{This paper reports experiments on the shear transient response of
	concentrated non-Brownian suspensions. The shear viscosity of the
	suspensions is measured using a wide-gap Couette rheometer equipped
	with a particle image velocimetry device that allows measuring the
	velocity field. The suspensions made of PMMA particles (31 mu m in
	diameter) suspended in a Newtonian index-and density-matched liquid
	are transparent enough to allow an accurate measurement of the local
	velocity for particle concentrations as high as 50\%. In the wide-gap
	Couette cell, the shear induced particle migration is evidenced by
	the measurement of the time evolution of the flow profile. A peculiar
	radial zone in the gap is identified where the viscosity remains
	constant. At this special location, the local particle volume fraction
	is taken to be the mean particle concentration. The local shear transient
	response of the suspensions when the shear flow is reversed is measured
	at this point where the particle volume fraction is well defined.
	The local rheological measurements presented here confirm the macroscopic
	measurements of Gadala-Maria and Acrivos {[}J. Rheol. 24, 799-814
	(1980)]. After shear reversal, the viscosity undergoes a steplike
	reduction, decreases slower, and passes through a minimum before
	increasing again to reach a plateau. Upon varying the particle concentration,
	we have been able to show that the minimum and the plateau viscosities
	do not obey the same scaling law with respect to the particle volume
	fraction. These experimental results are consistent with the scaling
	predicted by Mills and Snabre {[}Eur. Phys. J. E 30(3), 309-316 (2009)]
	and with the results of numerical simulation performed on random
	suspensions {[}Sierou and Brady, J. Fluid Mech. 448, 115-146 (2001)].
	The minimum seems to be associated with the viscosity of an isotropic
	suspension or at least of a suspension whose particles do not interact
	through non-hydrodynamic forces, while the plateau value would correspond
	to the viscosity of a suspension structured by the shear where the
	non-hydrodynamic forces play a crucial role. (C) 2011 The Society

	the influence of confinement on the self-diffusion coefficient (in

	the effect of confinement on the mode-coupling contribution to the

	transformed and shown to be proportional to the time integral of
	the autocorrelation function of the momentum transferred from the
	fluid to the Brownian sphere during instantaneous collisions. Three
	different methods are described to extract the friction coefficient
	from molecular dynamics simulations carried out onfinite systems.
	The three independent methods lead to estimates of $\psi$ which agree
	within statisticalerrors (typically 5\%). The results are compared
	to the predictions of Enskog theory and of the hydrodynamic Stokes
	law. The former breaks down as the size ratio and/or the packing
	fraction of the fluid increase. Somewhat surprisingly, Stokes' law
	is found to hold withstick boundary conditions, in the range 1≤$\Sigma$/$\sigma$≤4.5
	explored in the present simulations, with a hydrodynamic diameterd=$\Sigma$.

	Starting from an extended Boltzmann equation, which describes correctly
	the interaction with the fluid, we derive systematically via multiple-time-scale
	analysis a reduced equation controlling the thermalization of the
	B particle, i.e., the relaxation toward the Maxwell distribution
	in velocity space. In contradistinction to the Fokker-Planck equation,

	velocity space, owing to correlated recollision events between the

	generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. However, in spite of this
	complex dynamical behavior, the Stokes-Einstein law relating the

  abstract = {In this paper, we briefly review the boxed molecular dynamics (BXD)
	method which allows analysis of thermodynamics and kinetics in complicated
	molecular systems. BXD is a multiscale technique, in which thermodynamics
	and long-time dynamics are recovered from a set of short-time simulations.
	In this paper, we review previous applications of BXD to peptide
	cyclization, solution phase organic reaction dynamics and desorption
	of ions from self-assembled monolayers (SAMs). We also report preliminary
	results of simulations of diamond etching mechanisms and protein
	unfolding in atomic force microscopy experiments. The latter demonstrate
	a correlation between the protein's structural motifs and its potential
	of mean force. Simulations of these processes by standard molecular
	dynamics (MD) is typically not possible, because the experimental
	time scales are very long. However, BXD yields well-converged and
	physically meaningful results. Compared with other methods of accelerated
	MD, our BXD approach is very simple; it is easy to implement, and
	it provides an integrated approach for simultaneously obtaining both
	thermodynamics and kinetics. It also provides a strategy for obtaining
	statistically meaningful dynamical results in regions of configuration
	space that standard MD approaches would visit only very rarely.},

	applications with different characteristics and from several disciplines.
	Three modes of distributed multiscale computing are identified: supplementing
	local dependencies with large-scale resources, load distribution
	over multiple resources, and load balancing of small- and large-scale
	resources. We find that the first mode has the apparent benefit of
	increasing simulation speed, and the second mode can increase simulation

  journal = {J. Fluid Mech.},
  year = {2011},
  volume = {667},
  pages = {216-259},
  abstract = {{Diffusiophoresis, the motion of a particle in response to an externally
	imposed concentration gradient of a solute species, is analysed from
	both the traditional coarse-grained macroscopic (i.e. continuum)
	perspective and from a fine-grained micromechanical level in which
	the particle and the solute are treated on the same footing as Brownian
	particles dispersed in a solvent. It is shown that although the two
	approaches agree when the solute is much smaller in size than the
	phoretic particle and is present at very dilute concentrations, the
	micromechanical colloidal perspective relaxes these restrictions
	and applies to any size ratio and any concentration of solute. The
	different descriptions also provide different mechanical analyses
	of phoretic motion. At the continuum level the macroscopic hydrodynamic
	stress and interactive force with the solute sum to give zero total
	force, a condition for phoretic motion. At the colloidal level, the
	particle's motion is shown to have two contributions: (i) a `back-flow'
	contribution composed of the motion of the particle due to the solute
	chemical potential gradient force acting on it and a compensating
	fluid motion driven by the long-range hydrodynamic velocity disturbance
	caused by the chemical potential gradient force acting on all the
	solute particles and (ii) an indirect contribution arising from the
	mutual interparticle and Brownian forces on the solute and phoretic
	particle, that contribution being non-zero because the distribution
	of solute about the phoretic particle is driven out of equilibrium
	by the chemical potential gradient of the solute. At the colloidal
	level the forces acting on the phoretic particle both the statistical
	or `thermodynamic' chemical potential gradient and Brownian forces
	and the interparticle force are balanced by the Stokes drag of the
	solvent to give the net phoretic velocity. For a particle undergoing
	self-phoresis or autonomous motion, as can result from chemical reactions
	occurring asymmetrically on a particle surface, e.g. catalytic nanomotors,
	there is no imposed chemical potential gradient and the back-flow
	contribution is absent. Only the indirect Brownian and interparticle
	forces contribution is responsible for the motion. The velocity of
	the particle resulting from this contribution can be written in terms
	of a mobility times the integral of the local `solute pressure' the
	solute concentration times the thermal energy over the surface of
	contact between the particle and the solute. This was the approach
	taken by Cordova-Figueroa \& Brady (Phys. Rev. Lett., vol. 100, 2008,
	158303) in their analysis of self-propulsion. It is shown that full
	hydrodynamic interactions can be incorporated into their analysis
	by a simple scale factor.}},

  abstract = {Shear thickening is a type of non-Newtonian behavior in which the
	stress required to shear a fluid increases faster than linearly with
	shear rate. Many concentrated suspensions of particles exhibit an
	especially dramatic version, known as Discontinuous Shear Thickening
	(DST), in which the stress suddenly jumps with increasing shear rate
	and produces solid-like behavior. The best known example of such
	counter-intuitive response to applied stresses occurs in mixtures
	of cornstarch in water. Over the last several years, this shear-induced
	solid-like behavior together with a variety of other unusual fluid
	phenomena has generated considerable interest in the physics of densely
	packed suspensions. In this review, we discuss the common physical
	properties of systems exhibiting shear thickening, and different
	mechanisms and models proposed to describe it. We then suggest how
	these mechanisms may be related and generalized, and propose a general
	phase diagram for shear thickening systems. We also discuss how recent
	work has related the physics of shear thickening to that of granular
	materials and jammed systems. Since DST is described by models that
	require only simple generic interactions between particles, we outline
	the broader context of other concentrated many-particle systems such
	as foams and emulsions, and explain why DST is restricted to the
	parameter regime of hard-particle suspensions. Finally, we discuss
	some of the outstanding problems and emerging opportunities.},

  abstract = {A surface having a spatial gradient in its surface free energy was
	capable of causing drops of water placed on it to move uphill. This
	motion was the result of an imbalance in the forces due to surface
	tension acting on the liquid-solid contact line on the two opposite
	sides ("uphill" or "downhill") of the drop. The required gradient
	in surface free energy was generated on the surface of a polished
	silicon wafer by exposing it to the diffusing front of a vapor of
	decyltrichlorosilane, Cl3Si(CH2)9CH3. The resulting surface displayed
	a gradient of hydrophobicity (with the contact angle of water changing
	from 97° to 25°) over a distance of 1 centimeter. When the wafer
	was tilted from the horizontal plane by 15°, with the hydrophobic
	end lower than the hydrophilic, and a drop of water (1 to 2 microliters)
	was placed at the hydrophobic end, the drop moved toward the hydrophilic
	end with an average velocity of ∼1 to 2 millimeters per second. In
	order for the drop to move, the hysteresis in contact angle on the
	surface had to be low (≤10°).},

  abstract = {Many physical systems are described by nonlinear differential equations
	that are too complicated to solve in full. A natural way to proceed
	is to divide the variables into those that are of direct interest
	and those that are not, formulate solvable approximate equations
	for the variables of greater interest, and use data and statistical
	methods to account for the impact of the other variables. In the
	present paper we consider time-dependent problems and introduce a
	fully discrete solution method, which simplifies both the analysis
	of the data and the numerical algorithms. The resulting time series
	are identified by a NARMAX (nonlinear autoregression moving average
	with exogenous input) representation familiar from engineering practice.
	The connections with the Mori–Zwanzig formalism of statistical physics
	are discussed, as well as an application to the Lorenz 96 system.},

	of auric acid is explored as a function of temperature and reagent
	concentration. As aurate ions are reduced, the reaction medium changes
	from black to purple to blue before turning deep red. These color
	changes are shown to result from a decrease in particle size over
	the course of the reaction. Electrophoretic and titration studies
	suggest the colloidal properties of the sols result from a combination
	of van der Waals, electrostatic, and short-range repulsive interaction
	potentials. Increases in particle surface potential over the course
	of the reaction are shown to result from competitive adsorption of
	citrate and aurate ions. A particle growth model incorporating colloidal

	unfolded and folded states. The transition path defines how a single
	protein crosses the barrier and so contains key information on the
	mechanism of folding. Transition paths have not yet been experimentally
	observed, but Chung et al. have discovered which structural features
	of the protein affect the duration of the transition. As the protein
	folds, non-native salt bridges form and break, slowing diffusion
	along the transition path.Science, this issue p. 1504Experimental,
	theoretical, and computational studies of small proteins suggest
	that interresidue contacts not present in the folded structure play
	little or no role in the self-assembly mechanism. Non-native contacts
	can, however, influence folding kinetics by introducing additional
	local minima that slow diffusion over the global free-energy barrier
	between folded and unfolded states. Here, we combine single-molecule
	fluorescence with all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to discover
	the structural origin for the slow diffusion that markedly decreases
	the folding rate for a designed α-helical protein. Our experimental
	determination of transition path times and our analysis of the simulations
	point to non-native salt bridges between helices as the source, which
	provides a quantitative glimpse of how specific intramolecular interactions
	influence protein folding rates by altering dynamics and not activation
	free energies.},

  abstract = {The sedimentation of solid spherical particles in an initially quiescent
	fluid is investigated through numerical simulations. Under conditions
	of Stokes flow, the results provide good agreement with experiments
	for the mean settling velocity while the velocity fluctuation levels
	grow with the size of the system in accordance with theoretical predictions
	for homogeneous suspensions. New results on finite Reynolds number
	suspensions are presented that illustrate the role of wake-induced
	interactions between particles. A significant reduction in the average
	settling velocity is explained by an enhancement of a wake-induced
	scattering process. Anisotropy in the fluid flow is evident and the
	evolution of velocity correlations is investigated for various particulate
	Reynolds numbers. Increases in Reynolds number tend to decrease the
	integral length scale of the fluctuating flow field and reduce significantly
	the Lagrangian time scale of the velocity fluctuations. Analysis
	of the evolution of fluctuation levels when the domain width grows
	indicates that inertial screening dramatically reduces the divergence.

  abstract  = {Electrons inside a conductor are often described as flowing in response
	to an electric field. This flow rarely resembles anything like the
	familiar flow of water through a pipe, but three groups describe
	counterexamples (see the Perspective by Zaanen). Moll et al. found
	that the viscosity of the electron fluid in thin wires of PdCoO2
	had a major effect on the flow, much like what happens in regular
	fluids. Bandurin et al. found evidence in graphene of electron whirlpools
	similar to those formed by viscous fluid flowing through a small
	opening. Finally, Crossno et al. observed a huge increase of thermal
	transport in graphene, a signature of so-called Dirac fluids.Science,
	this issue p. 1061, 1055, 1058; see also p. 1026Interactions between
	particles in quantum many-body systems can lead to collective behavior
	described by hydrodynamics. One such system is the electron-hole
	plasma in graphene near the charge-neutrality point, which can form
	a strongly coupled Dirac fluid. This charge-neutral plasma of quasi-relativistic
	fermions is expected to exhibit a substantial enhancement of the
	thermal conductivity, thanks to decoupling of charge and heat currents
	within hydrodynamics. Employing high-sensitivity Johnson noise thermometry,
	we report an order of magnitude increase in the thermal conductivity
	and the breakdown of the Wiedemann-Franz law in the thermally populated
	charge-neutral plasma in graphene. This result is a signature of
	the Dirac fluid and constitutes direct evidence of collective motion
	in a quantum electronic fluid.},

	of existing simplified models is strongly hindered either from the
	complete removal of frustration (as in the widely used Gō-like models)
	or from the compromise with the minimal frustration principle and/or
	realistic protein geometry (as in the simple on-lattice models).
	We present a coarse-grained model that “naturally” incorporates sequence
	details and energetic frustration into an overall minimally frustrated
	folding landscape. The model is coupled with an optimization procedure
	to design the parameters of the protein Hamiltonian to fold into
	a desired native structure. The application to the study of src-Src
	homology 3 domain shows that this coarse-grained model contains the
	main physical-chemical ingredients that are responsible for shaping
	the folding landscape of this protein. The results illustrate the
	importance of nonnative interactions and energetic heterogeneity

	The dissipative particles follow the dynamics of extended objects
	subject to forces including pressure and stresses. The stresses and
	heat fluxes are computed through constitutive relations, which lead
	to fluctuating Navier–Stokes hydrodynamics for the solvent. The present
	formulation is based on the use of statistical mechanical distribution
	functions and the connection with the underlying molecular description
	of the fluid is maintained through the pair–distribution function
	and the intermolecular potential. The main features of this DPD method
	are the adaptivity of the dissipative particles to the important
	length–scales of the problem and the explicit role played by the
	molecular pair–distribution function.},

  abstract = {The numerical convergence of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH)
	can be severely restricted by random force errors induced by particle
	disorder, especially in shear flows, which are ubiquitous in astrophysics.
	The increase in the number NH of neighbours when switching to more
	extended smoothing kernels at fixed resolution (using an appropriate
	definition for the SPH resolution scale) is insufficient to combat
	these errors. Consequently, trading resolution for better convergence
	is necessary, but for traditional smoothing kernels this option is
	limited by the pairing (or clumping) instability. Therefore, we investigate
	the suitability of the Wendland functions as smoothing kernels and
	compare them with the traditional B-splines. Linear stability analysis
	in three dimensions and test simulations demonstrate that the Wendland
	kernels avoid the pairing instability for all NH, despite having
	vanishing derivative at the origin (disproving traditional ideas
	about the origin of this instability; instead, we uncover a relation
	with the kernel Fourier transform and give an explanation in terms
	of the SPH density estimator). The Wendland kernels are computationally
	more convenient than the higher order B-splines, allowing large NH
	and hence better numerical convergence (note that computational costs
	rise sublinear with NH). Our analysis also shows that at low NH the
	quartic spline kernel with NH ≈ 60 obtains much better convergence
	than the standard cubic spline.},

	require a multi-scale approach. A hybrid technique is proposed to
	handle multi-scale phenomena, which retains the full molecular nature
	of the system where it is of interest while coarse-graining it elsewhere.
	The method couples molecular dynamics (MD) and fluctuating hydrodynamics
	(FH) based on the Landau theory. Mean flows involving transport of
	transversal (shear) and longitudinal momentum (sound) are coupled
	across the interface of both MD and FH domains. Hydrodynamic fluctuations
	of mass and momentum are transferred, preserving consistency with
	hydrodynamics and thermodynamics. Here the hybrid method is illustrated
	by studying the reflection of water sound waves against a lipid (dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine)
	monolayer.},

  abstract = {Recently the author used an information theoretical formulation of
	non-equilibrium statistical mechanics (MaxEnt) to derive the fluctuation
	theorem (FT) concerning the probability of second law violating phase-space
	paths. A less rigorous argument leading to the variational principle
	of maximum entropy production (MEP) was also given. Here a more rigorous
	and general mathematical derivation of MEP from MaxEnt is presented,
	and the relationship between MEP and the FT is thereby clarified.
	Specifically, it is shown that the FT allows a general orthogonality
	property of maximum information entropy to be extended to entropy
	production itself, from which MEP then follows. The new derivation
	highlights MEP and the FT as generic properties of MaxEnt probability
	distributions involving anti-symmetric constraints, independently
	of any physical interpretation. Physically, MEP applies to the entropy
	production of those macroscopic fluxes that are free to vary under
	the imposed constraints, and corresponds to selection of the most
	probable macroscopic flux configuration. In special cases MaxEnt
	also leads to various upper bound transport principles. The relationship
	between MaxEnt and previous theories of irreversible processes due
	to Onsager, Prigogine and Ziegler is also clarified in the light
	of these results.},

  abstract = {{The velocity fluctuations present in macroscopically homogeneous
	suspensions of neutrally buoyant non-Brownian spheres undergoing
	simple shear flow, and their dependence on the microstructure developed
	by the suspensions, are investigated in the limit of vanishingly
	small Reynolds numbers using Stokesian dynamics simulations. We show
	that, in the dilute limit, the standard deviation of the velocity
	fluctuations (the so-called suspension temperature) is proportional
	to the volume fraction, in both the transverse and the flow directions,
	and that a theoretical prediction, which considers only the hydrodynamic
	interactions between isolated pairs of spheres, is in good agreement
	with the numerical results at low concentrations. We also simulate
	the velocity fluctuations that would result from a random hard-sphere
	distribution of spheres in simple shear flow, and thereby investigate
	the effects of the microstructure on the velocity fluctuations. Analogous
	results are discussed for the fluctuations in the angular velocity
	of the suspended spheres. In addition, we present the probability
	density functions for all the linear and angular velocity components,
	and for three different concentrations, showing a transition from
	a Gaussian to an exponential and finally to a stretched exponential
	functional form as the volume fraction is decreased. The simulations
	include a non-hydrodynamic repulsive force between the spheres which,
	although extremely short range, leads to the development of fore-aft
	asymmetric distributions for large enough volume fractions, if the
	range of that force is kept unchanged. On the other hand, we show
	that, although the pair distribution function recovers its fore-aft
	symmetry in dilute suspensions, it remains anisotropic and that this
	anisotropy can be accurately predicted theoretically from the two-sphere
	solution by assuming the complete absence of any permanent doublets
	of spheres. We also present a simple correction to the analysis of
	laser-Doppler velocimetry measurements, which substantially improves
	the interpretation of these measurements at low volume fractions
	even though it involves only the angular velocity of a single sphere
	in the vorticity direction. Finally, in an Appendix, we show that,
	in the dilute limit, the whole velocity autocorrelation function
	can be predicted using again only two-particle encounters.}},

	neutrally buoyant, non-Brownian spheres is investigated in the limit
	of vanishingly small Reynolds numbers using Stokesian dynamics. We
	show that the complex dynamics of sheared suspensions can be characterized
	as a chaotic motion in phase space and determine the dependence of
	the largest Lyapunov exponent on the volume fraction phi. We also
	offer evidence that the chaotic motion is responsible for the loss
	of memory in the evolution of the system and demonstrate this loss
	of correlation in phase space. The loss of memory at the microscopic
	level of individual particles is also shown in terms of the autocorrelation
	functions for the two transverse velocity components. Moreover, a
	negative correlation in the transverse particle velocities is seen
	to exist at the lower concentrations, an effect which we explain
	on the basis of the dynamics of two isolated spheres undergoing simple
	shear. In addition, we calculate the probability distribution function
	of the transverse velocity fluctuations and observe, with increasing
	phi, a transition from exponential to Gaussian distributions. The
	simulations include a non-hydrodynamic repulsive interaction between
	the spheres which qualitatively models the effects of surface roughness
	and other irreversible effects, such as residual Brownian displacements,
	that become particularly important whenever pairs of spheres are
	nearly touching. We investigate, for very dilute suspensions, the
	effects of such a non-hydrodynamic interparticle force on the scaling
	of the particle tracer diffusion coefficients D-y and D-z respectively,
	along and normal to the plane of shear, and show that, when this
	force is very short-ranged, both are proportional to phi(2) as phi
	--> 0. In contrast, when the range of the nonhydrodynamic interaction
	is increased, we observe a crossover in the dependence of D-y on
	phi(2), from phi(2) to phi as phi --> 0. We also estimate that a
	similar crossover exists for D-z but at a value of phi one order
	of magnitude lower than that which we were able to reach in our simulations.}},

  abstract = {Locomotion and transport of microorganisms in fluids is an essential
	aspect of life. Search for food, orientation toward light, spreading
	of off-spring, and the formation of colonies are only possible due
	to locomotion. Swimming at the microscale occurs at low Reynolds
	numbers, where fluid friction and viscosity dominates over inertia.
	Here, evolution achieved propulsion mechanisms, which overcome and
	even exploit drag. Prominent propulsion mechanisms are rotating helical
	flagella, exploited by many bacteria, and snake-like or whip-like
	motion of eukaryotic flagella, utilized by sperm and algae. For artificial
	microswimmers, alternative concepts to convert chemical energy or
	heat into directed motion can be employed, which are potentially
	more efficient. The dynamics of microswimmers comprises many facets,
	which are all required to achieve locomotion. In this article, we
	review the physics of locomotion of biological and synthetic microswimmers,
	and the collective behavior of their assemblies. Starting from individual
	microswimmers, we describe the various propulsion mechanism of biological
	and synthetic systems and address the hydrodynamic aspects of swimming.
	This comprises synchronization and the concerted beating of flagella
	and cilia. In addition, the swimming behavior next to surfaces is
	examined. Finally, collective and cooperate phenomena of various
	types of isotropic and anisotropic swimmers with and without hydrodynamic
	interactions are discussed.},

  abstract = {Mesoscopic-particle–based fluid models, such as dissipative particle
	dynamics, are usually assumed to be coarse-grained representations
	of an underlying microscopic fluid. A fundamental question is whether
	there exists a map from microscopic particles in these systems to
	the corresponding coarse-grained particles, such that the coarse-grained
	system has the same bulk and transport properties as the underlying
	system. In this letter, we investigate the coarse-graining of microscopic
	fluids using a Voronoi-type projection that has been suggested in
	several studies. The simulations show that the projection fails in
	defining coarse-grained particles that have a physically meaningful
	connection to the microscopic fluid. In particular, the Voronoi projection
	produces identical coarse-grained equilibrium properties when applied
	to systems with different microscopic interactions and different
	bulk properties.},

  abstract  = {Coarse-graining (CG) of complex molecules is a way to reach time scales
	that would be impossible to access through brute force molecular
	simulations. In this paper{,} we formulate a coarse-grained model
	for complex molecules from first principles that ensures energy conservation.
	Each molecule is described in a coarse way by a thermal blob characterized
	by the position and momentum of the center of mass of the molecule{,}
	together with its internal energy as an additional degree of freedom.
	This level of description gives rise to an entropy-based framework
	instead of the usual one based on the configurational free energy
	(i.e. potential of mean force). The resulting dynamic equations{,}
	which account for a proper description of heat transfer at the coarse
	grained level{,} have the structure of the Dissipative Particle Dynamics
	with Energy conservation (DPDE) model but with a clear microscopic
	underpinning. Under suitable approximations{,} we provide explicit
	microscopic expressions for each component (entropy{,} mean force{,}
	friction and conductivity coefficients) appearing in the coarse-grained
	model. These quantities can be computed directly from MD simulations.
	The proposed non-isothermal coarse-grained model is thermodynamically
	consistent and opens up a first principles CG strategy to the study
	of energy transport issues that are not accessible with current isothermal
	models.},

	In addition{,} we show an alternative Bayesian argument that starts
	from the path probability of a diffusion process which allows one
	to obtain the best parametrised model that fits an actual observed

  abstract                   = {{Yield stress fluids have proven difficult to characterize, and a
	reproducible determination of the yield stress is difficult. We study
	two types of yield stress fluids (YSF) in a single system: simple
	and thixotropic ones. This allows us to show that simple YSF are
	simply a special case of thixotropic ones, and to pinpoint the difference
	between static and dynamic yield stresses, one of the major problems
	in the field. The thixotropic systems show a strong time dependence
	of the viscosity due to the existence of an internal percolated structure
	that confers the yield stress to the material. Using loaded emulsions
	to control the thixotropy, we show that the transition to flow at
	the yield stress is discontinuous for thixotropic materials, and
	continuous for ideal ones. The discontinuity leads to a critical
	shear rate below which no steady flows can be observed, accounting
	for the ubiquitous shear banding observed in these materials.}},

  abstract  = {The motion of red blood cells (RBCs) in microcirculation plays an
	important role in blood flow resistance and in the cell partitioning
	within a microvascular network. Different shapes and dynamics of
	RBCs in microvessels have been previously observed experimentally
	including the parachute and slipper shapes. We employ mesoscale hydrodynamic
	simulations to predict the phase diagram of shapes and dynamics of
	RBCs in cylindrical microchannels{,} which serve as idealized microvessels{,}
	for a wide range of channel confinements and flow rates. A rich dynamical
	behavior is found{,} with snaking and tumbling discocytes{,} slippers
	performing a swinging motion{,} and stationary parachutes. We discuss
	the effects of different RBC states on the flow resistance{,} and
	the influence of RBC properties{,} characterized by the Foppl-von
	Karman number{,} on the shape diagram. The simulations are performed
	using the same viscosity for both external and internal fluids surrounding
	a RBC; however{,} we discuss how the viscosity contrast would affect
	the shape diagram.},

  abstract  = {Janus colloids propelled by light{,} e.g.{,} thermophoretic particles{,}
	offer promising prospects as artificial microswimmers. However{,}
	their swimming behavior and its dependence on fluid properties and
	fluid-colloid interactions remain poorly understood. Here{,} we investigate
	the behavior of a thermophoretic Janus colloid in its own temperature
	gradient using numerical simulations. The dissipative particle dynamics
	method with energy conservation is used to investigate the behavior
	in non-ideal and ideal-gas like fluids for different fluid-colloid
	interactions{,} boundary conditions{,} and temperature-controlling
	strategies. The fluid-colloid interactions appear to have a strong
	effect on the colloid behavior{,} since they directly affect heat
	exchange between the colloid surface and the fluid. The simulation
	results show that a reduction of the heat exchange at the fluid-colloid
	interface leads to an enhancement of colloid{'}s thermophoretic mobility.
	The colloid behavior is found to be different in non-ideal and ideal
	fluids{,} suggesting that fluid compressibility plays a significant
	role. The flow field around the colloid surface is found to be dominated
	by a source-dipole{,} in agreement with the recent theoretical and
	simulation predictions. Finally{,} different temperature-control
	strategies do not appear to have a strong effect on the colloid{'}s
	swimming velocity.},

	a model system of colloidal hard spheres. The kinetics of the solidification
	process was measured using time resolved static light scattering{,}
	while the time evolution of the dynamic properties was determined
	using time resolved dynamic light scattering. By performing further
	analysis we confirm that solidification of hard sphere colloids is
	mediated by precursors. Analyzing the dynamic properties we can show
	that the long time dynamics and thus the shear rigidity of the metastable
	melt is highly correlated with the number density of solid clusters
	(precursors) nucleated. In crystallization these objects convert
	into highly ordered crystals whereas in the case of vitrification
	this conversion is blocked and the system is (temporarily) locked
	in the metastable precursor state. From the early stages of solidification
	one cannot clearly conclude whether the melt will crystallize or
	vitrify. Furthermore our data suggests that colloidal hard sphere
	glasses can crystallize via homogeneous nucleation.},

	of Peridynamics and Smooth-Particle-Hydrodynamics (SPH), if Peridynamics
	is applied to classical material models based on the deformation
	gradient. We show that the discretized equations of both methods
	coincide if nodal integration is used. This equivalence implies that
	Peridynamics reduces to an old meshless method and all instability
	problems of collocation-type particle methods apply. These instabilities
	arise as a consequence of the nodal integration scheme, which causes
	rank-deficiency and leads to spurious zero-energy modes. As a result
	of the demonstrated equivalence to SPH, enhanced implementations
	of Peridynamics should employ more accurate integration schemes.

	are investigated with dissipative particle simulations at constant
	energy (DPDE). A coarse-grained model for the phospholipid bilayer
	in aqueous environment is employed{,} which models single lipids
	as short chains consisting of a hydrophilic head and two hydrophobic
	tail beads. Water is modeled by mapping four H2O molecules to one
	water bead. Using the DPDE method enables us to faithfully simulate
	the non-equilibrium shock-wave process with a coarse-grained model
	as the correct heat capacity can be recovered. At equilibrium{,}
	we obtain self-stabilizing bilayer structures that exhibit bending
	stiffness and compression modulus comparable to experimental measurements
	under physiological conditions. We study in detail the damage behavior
	of the coarse-grained lipid bilayer upon high-speed shock-wave impact
	as a function of shock impact velocity and bilayer stability. A single
	damage parameter based on an orientation dependent correlation function
	is introduced. We observe that mechanical bilayer stability has only
	small influence on the resulting damage after shock-wave impact{,}
	and inertial effects play almost no role. At shock-front velocities
	below [less{,} similar] 3000 ms-1{,} we observe reversible damage{,}
	whereas for speeds [greater{,} similar] 3900 ms-1 no such recovery{,}
	or self-repair of the bilayer{,} could be observed.},

  abstract = {In many applications, the primary objective of numerical simulation
	of time-evolving systems is the prediction of coarse-grained, or
	macroscopic, quantities. The purpose of this review is twofold: first,
	to describe a number of simple model systems where the coarse-grained
	or macroscopic behaviour of a system can be explicitly determined
	from the full, or microscopic, description; and second, to overview
	some of the emerging algorithmic approaches that have been introduced
	to extract effective, lower-dimensional, macroscopic dynamics. The
	model problems we describe may be either stochastic or deterministic
	in both their microscopic and macroscopic behaviour, leading to four
	possibilities in the transition from microscopic to macroscopic descriptions.
	Model problems are given which illustrate all four situations, and
	mathematical tools for their study are introduced. These model problems
	are useful in the evaluation of algorithms. We use specific instances
	of the model problems to illustrate these algorithms. As the subject
	of algorithm development and analysis is, in many cases, in its infancy,
	the primary purpose here is to attempt to unify some of the emerging
	ideas so that individuals new to the field have a structured access
	to the literature. Furthermore, by discussing the algorithms in the
	context of the model problems, a platform for understanding existing
	algorithms and developing new ones is built.},

  abstract  = {When a liquid is confined in a narrow gap (as near a cell membrane,
	in a lubricated contact between solids, or in a porous medium), new
	dynamic behavior emerges. The effective shear viscosity is enhanced
	compared to the bulk, relaxation times are prolonged, and nonlinear
	responses set in at lower shear rates. These effects are more prominent,
	the thinner the liquid film. They appear to be the manifestation
	of collective motions. The flow of liquids under extreme confinement
	cannot be understood simply by intuitive extrapolation of bulk properties.
	Practical consequences are possible in areas from tribology and materials
	processing to membrane physics.},

  abstract = {Various empirical equations used for expressing the compressive properties
	of liquids have been studied. Despite its popularity, the well-known
	equation attributed to Tait has several undesirable features; moreover,
	it is in fact not Tait's original equation, but is the result of
	an accidental misquotation by a later writer. Tait's original equation,
	when rearranged, leads to an equation of the form V 0 P / V 0 - V
	= K 0 + mP where K 0 is the bulk modulus at zero pressure and m the
	slope of the bulk-modulus-pressure curve. The equations of Tumlirz
	and of Tammann are merely rearrangements of the above equation. The
	spurious version of the Tait equation, Hudleston's equation, MacDonald's
	equation and the Van der Waal equation of state are all asymptotic
	to it at zero pressure, and are practically equivalent to it over
	the normal range of application. The above equation is both the most
	accurate and the most convenient two-constant compressibility equation
	available. By the addition of a term in P 2 the equation can be adapted
	to fit data for water up to 12 kb; a further term in P 3 is needed
	to accommodate a wide range of organic liquids up to 12 kb.},

	and simulation has enjoyed significant success within the past decade,
	it still holds many open questions that are deemed important but
	so far have barely been explored. We believe that this is at least
	in part due to the fact that the field has been mainly developed
	within disciplinary silos. The principal topics that in our view
	would benefit from a targeted multidisciplinary research effort are
	related to reaching consensus as to what exactly one means by ‘multiscale
	modelling’, formulating a generic theory or calculus of multiscale
	modelling, applying such concepts to the urgent question of validation
	and verification of multiscale models, and the issue of numerical
	error propagation in multiscale models. Moreover, we believe that
	this would, in principle, also lay the foundation for more efficient,
	well-defined and usable multiscale computing environments. We believe
	that multidisciplinary research to fill in the gaps is timely, highly
	relevant, and with substantial potential impact on many scientific
	disciplines.},

  abstract = {{As one increases the concentration of a colloidal suspension, the
	system exhibits a dramatic increase in viscosity. Beyond a certain
	concentration, the system is said to be a colloidal glass; structurally,
	the system resembles a liquid, yet motions within the suspension
	are slow enough that it can be considered essentially frozen. For
	several decades, colloids have served as a valuable model system
	for understanding the glass transition in molecular systems. The
	spatial and temporal scales involved allow these systems to be studied
	by a wide variety of experimental techniques. The focus of this review
	is the current state of understanding of the colloidal glass transition,
	with an emphasis on experimental observations. A brief introduction
	is given to important experimental techniques used to study the glass
	transition in colloids. We describe features of colloidal systems
	near and in glassy states, including increases in viscosity and relaxation
	times, dynamical heterogeneity and ageing, among others. We also
	compare and contrast the glass transition in colloids to that in
	molecular liquids. Other glassy systems are briefly discussed, as
	well as recently developed synthesis techniques that will keep these
	systems rich with interesting physics for years to come.}},

  abstract = {Evolutionary calculations of rotating gaseous flows around astrophysical
	objects with standard smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) result
	in inaccurate evolutions of shear flows. The large density errors
	(Δρ ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gtrsim.gif] {gtrsim}
	ρ) emerge within one dynamical time of the system when we adopt the
	mean separation of the particles as a smoothing length, h . We show
	that these errors originate in the definition of density and the
	inaccurate solution of the continuity equation in standard SPH. Standard
	SPH ensures the global mass conservation but does not ensure the
	local mass conservation. Thus, we reformulate the SPH method and
	find the expression of the consistent velocity field in terms of
	particle velocities that ensure local mass conservation. We update
	the particle positions using particle velocities instead of fluid
	velocities. These two velocities should be different theoretically.
	The numerical examples of the improved method are shown. The implementation
	of SPH described in this paper is crucial for the long-term calculations
	of the shear flows in differentially rotating stars, circumstellar
	disks, and galactic gaseous disks.},

	the tendency to lift off the boundary{,} leading to its removal.
	In the equilibrium contact angle range{,} [curly or open theta]>120[degree]{,}
	the drop preserves its integrity as it escapes from the boundary{,}
	whereas at lower contact angles the drop assumes a distinctly elongated
	shape prior to its removal{,} which develops {"}necks{'}{'} at subsequent
	times. The drop breaks up as the necks are ruptured upon thinning{,}
	with some fragments escaping into the bulk phase and some remaining
	at the surface. Under certain hydrodynamic conditions the moving
	drop sheds a trail of tiny droplets on the surface. The simulation
	results are in qualitative agreement with experimental studies on

	the perpendicular components of the relative velocity{,} whilst keeping
	the advantages of conserving Galilei invariance and within our error
	bar also hydrodynamics. This leads to a second friction parameter
	for tuning the transport properties of the system. Numerical simulations
	of a simple Lennard-Jones fluid and liquid water demonstrate a very
	sensitive behaviour of the transport properties{,} e.g.{,} viscosity{,}
	on the strength of the new friction parameter. We envisage that the
	new thermostat will be very useful for the coarse-grained and adaptive
	resolution simulations of soft matter{,} where the diffusion constants
	and viscosities of the coarse-grained models are typically too high/low{,}
	respectively{,} compared to all-atom simulations.},

	from the original active drugs used in their composition{,} and distinct
	from first generation NPs that largely facilitated drug formulation.
	A greater flexibility in the design of drug molecules themselves
	may also be facilitated following their incorporation into NPs{,}
	as drug properties (solubility{,} metabolism{,} plasma binding{,}
	biodistribution{,} target tissue accumulation) will no longer be
	constrained to the same extent by drug chemical composition{,} but
	also become in-part the function of the physicochemical properties
	of the NP. The combination of optimally designed drugs with optimally
	engineered polymeric NPs opens up the possibility of improved clinical
	outcomes that may not be achievable with the administration of drugs
	in their conventional form. In this critical review{,} we aim to
	provide insights into the design and development of targeted polymeric
	NPs and to highlight the challenges associated with the engineering
	of this novel class of therapeutics{,} including considerations of
	NP design optimization{,} development and biophysicochemical properties.
	Additionally{,} we highlight some recent examples from the literature{,}
	which demonstrate current trends and novel concepts in both the design
	and utility of targeted polymeric NPs (444 references).},

	fluid over a highly extended dynamic range. We introduce a coupled
	harmonically bound Brownian particle (c-HBBP) model{,} in which the
	relaxation modes of the viscoelastic medium are treated as harmonic
	wells. These wells are coupled to the probe sphere and perform Brownian
	motion in bound harmonic potentials corresponding to the next-longer
	relaxation mode{,} according to the relaxation spectrum of the viscoelastic
	material. We implement this c-HBBP model by generating variable temporal
	step sizes that have a uniform distribution in logarithmic time.
	We create and analyze trajectories for several different viscoelastic
	complex fluids: a polymer system at its gel point{,} a dense emulsion
	system{,} a blend of two monodisperse polystyrene polymers for which
	the relaxation spectrum has been measured{,} and a model anisotropic
	soft system that shows dense emulsion-like and gel-point behaviors
	along two orthogonal directions. Except for unusual viscoelastic
	materials{,} such as the polymer system at its gel point{,} the generated
	trajectories are neither self-similar nor self-affine. The resulting
	mean square displacements predicted by the c-HBBP model are consistent

	linear passive microrheology.},

  abstract = {We present nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations of the flow
	of liquid–vapour water mixtures and mixtures of water and nitrogen
	inside carbon nanotubes. A new adaptive forcing scheme is proposed
	to impose a mean flow through the system. The flow of liquid water
	is characterised by a distinct layering of the water molecules in
	the vicinity of the boundary and a slip length that is found to increase
	with the radius of the carbon nanotube. Increasing the temperature
	and pressure of the system furthermore results in a decrease in the
	slip length. For the flow of mixtures of nitrogen and water we find
	that the slip length is reduced as compared to the slip for the pure
	water. The shorter slip length is attributed to the fact that nitrogen
	forms droplets at the carbon surface, thus partially shielding the
	bulk flow from the hydrophobic carbon surface. },

	theorem which states that the linear response of a given system to

	of the system in thermal equilibrium. This theorem may be represented
	by a stochastic equation describing the fluctuation, which is a generalization
	of the familiar Langevin equation in the classical theory of Brownian
	motion. In this generalized equation the friction force becomes retarded
	or frequency-dependent and the random force is no more white. They
	are related to each other by a generalized Nyquist theorem which
	is in fact another expression of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem.
	This point of view can be applied to a wide class of irreversible
	process including collective modes in many-particle systems as has
	already been shown by Mori. As an illustrative example, the density
	response problem is briefly discussed.},

  abstract = {Cell motility in viscous fluids is ubiquitous and affects many biological
	processes, including reproduction, infection and the marine life
	ecosystem. Here we review the biophysical and mechanical principles
	of locomotion at the small scales relevant to cell swimming, tens
	of micrometers and below. At this scale, inertia is unimportant and
	the Reynolds number is small. Our emphasis is on the simple physical
	picture and fundamental flow physics phenomena in this regime. We
	first give a brief overview of the mechanisms for swimming motility,
	and of the basic properties of flows at low Reynolds number, paying
	special attention to aspects most relevant for swimming such as resistance
	matrices for solid bodies, flow singularities and kinematic requirements
	for net translation. Then we review classical theoretical work on
	cell motility, in particular early calculations of swimming kinematics
	with prescribed stroke and the application of resistive force theory
	and slender-body theory to flagellar locomotion. After examining
	the physical means by which flagella are actuated, we outline areas
	of active research, including hydrodynamic interactions, biological
	locomotion in complex fluids, the design of small-scale artificial
	swimmers and the optimization of locomotion strategies.},

  abstract = {We investigate the stationary nonequilibrium (heat transporting) states
	of the Lorentz gas. This is a gas of classical point particles moving
	in a region gL containing also fixed (hard sphere) scatterers of
	radiusR. The stationary state considered is obtained by imposing
	stochastic boundary conditions at the top and bottom of $\Lambda$,
	i.e., a particle hitting one of these walls comes off with a velocity
	distribution corresponding to temperaturesT1 andT2 respectively,T1
	<T2. Letting$\rho$ be the average density of the randomly distributed
	scatterers we show that in the Boltzmann-Grad limit,$\rho${\textrightarrow}∞,R{\textrightarrow}
	0 with the mean free path fixed, the stationary distribution of the
	Lorentz gas converges in theL1-norm to the stationary distribution
	of the corresponding linear Boltzmann equation with the same boundary
	conditions. In particular, the steady state heat flow in the Lorentz
	gas converges to that of the linear Boltzmann equation, which is
	known to behave as (T2-T1)/L for largeL, whereL is the distance from
	the bottom to the top wall: i.e., Fourier's law of heat conduction
	is valid in the limit. The heat flow converges even in probability.
	Generalizations of our result for scatterers with a smooth potential
	as well as the related diffusion problem are discussed.},

  abstract = {It is anticipated that in future generations of massively parallel
	computer systems a significant portion of processors may suffer from
	hardware or software faults rendering large-scale computations useless.
	In this work we address this problem from the algorithmic side, proposing
	resilient algorithms that can recover from such faults irrespective
	of their fault origin. In particular, we set the foundations of a
	new class of algorithms that will combine numerical approximations
	with machine learning methods. To this end, we consider three types
	of fault scenarios: (1) a gappy region but with no previous gaps
	and no contamination of surrounding simulation data, (2) a space–time
	gappy region but with full spatiotemporal information and no contamination,
	and (3) previous gaps with contamination of surrounding data. To
	recover from such faults we employ different reconstruction and simulation
	methods, namely the projective integration, the co-Kriging interpolation,
	and the resimulation method. In order to compare the effectiveness
	of these methods for the different processor faults and to quantify
	the error propagation in each case, we perform simulations of two
	benchmark flows, flow in a cavity and flow past a circular cylinder.
	In general, the projective integration seems to be the most effective
	method when the time gaps are small, and the resimulation method
	is the best when the time gaps are big while the co-Kriging method
	is independent of time gaps. Furthermore, the projective integration
	method and the co-Kriging method are found to be good estimation
	methods for the initial and boundary conditions of the resimulation
	method in scenario (3).},

	material composed of woven Kevlar(R) fabric impregnated with a colloidal

	resistant composite material. Fragment simulation projectile (FSP)
	ballistic penetration measurements at similar to244 m/s have been
	performed to demonstrate the efficacy of the novel composite material.
	The results demonstrate a significant enhancement in ballistic penetration
	resistance due to the addition of shear thickening fluid to the fabric,
	without any loss in material flexibility. Furthermore, under these
	ballistic test conditions, the impregnated fabric targets perform
	equivalently to neat fabric targets of equal areal density, while
	offering significantly less thickness and more material flexibility.
	The enhancement in ballistic performance is shown to be associated
	with the shear thickening response, and possible mechanisms of fabric-fluid
	interaction during ballistic impact are identified. (C) 2003 Kluwer

  abstract = {Vasoocclusion crisis is a key hallmark of sickle cell anemia. Although
	early studies suggest that this crisis is caused by blockage of a
	single elongated cell, recent experiments have revealed that vasoocclusion
	is a complex process triggered by adhesive interactions among different
	cell groups in multiple stages. However, the quantification of the
	biophysical characteristics of sickle cell anemia remains an open
	issue. Based on dissipative particle dynamics, we develop a multiscale
	model for the sickle red blood cells (SS-RBCs), accounting for diversity
	in both shapes and cell rigidities, to investigate the precise mechanism
	of vasoocclusion. First, we investigate the adhesive dynamics of
	a single SS-RBC in shear flow and static conditions, and find that
	the different cell groups (SS2: young-deformable SS-RBCs, ISCs: rigid-irreversible
	SS-RBCs) exhibit heterogeneous adhesive behavior due to the diverse
	cell morphologies and membrane rigidities. We quantify the observed
	adhesion behavior (in static conditions) in terms of a balance of
	free energies due to cell adhesion and deformation, and propose a
	power law that relates the free-energy increase as a function of
	the contact area. We further simulate postcapillary flow of SS-RBC
	suspensions with different cell fractions. The more adhesive SS2
	cells interact with the vascular endothelium and trap ISC cells,
	resulting in vasoocclusion in vessels less than depending on the
	hematocrit. Under inflammation, adherent leukocytes may also trap
	ISC cells, resulting in vasoocclusion in even larger vessels.},

	control temperature while preserving the momentum, a family of particle
	simulation methods commonly used for the modelling of complex fluids
	and polymers. The class of methods considered includes dissipative
	particle dynamics (DPD) as well as extended stochastic-dynamics models
	incorporating a generalized pairwise thermostat scheme in which stochastic
	forces are eliminated and the coefficient of dissipation is treated
	as an additional auxiliary variable subject to a feedback (kinetic
	energy) control mechanism. In the latter case, we consider the addition
	of a coupling of the auxiliary variable, as in the Nosé–Hoover–Langevin
	(NHL) method, with stochastic dynamics to ensure ergodicity, and
	find that the convergence of ensemble averages is substantially improved.
	To this end, splitting methods are developed and studied in terms
	of their thermodynamic accuracy, two-point correlation functions,
	and convergence. In terms of computational efficiency as measured
	by the ratio of thermodynamic accuracy to \{CPU\} time, we report
	significant advantages in simulation for the pairwise \{NHL\} method
	compared to popular alternative schemes (up to an 80% improvement),
	without degradation of convergence rate. The momentum-conserving
	thermostat technique described here provides a consistent hydrodynamic
	model in the low-friction regime, but it will also be of use in both
	equilibrium and nonequilibrium molecular simulation applications
	owing to its efficiency and simple numerical implementation. },

	experiments that examine red blood cell (RBC) mechanics, rheology
	and dynamics. First, we investigated RBC deformability in a microfluidic
	channel with a very small cross-sectional area and quantified the
	mechanical properties of the RBC membrane. Second, we simulated twisting
	torque cytometry and compared predicted rheological properties of
	the RBC membrane with experimental measurements. Finally, we modelled
	the tank-treading (TT) motion of a RBC in a shear flow and explored
	the effect of channel width variation on the TT frequency. We also
	investigated the effects of bilayer–cytoskeletal interactions on
	these experiments and our simulations clearly indicated that they
	play key roles in the determination of cell membrane mechanical,
	rheological and dynamical properties. These simulations serve as
	validation tests and moreover reveal the capabilities and limitations

	cluster{,} we compute both the conservative and non-conservative
	interactions between neighboring clusters. In particular{,} we perform
	MD simulations of polymer melts to provide microscopic trajectories
	for evaluating coarse-grained (CG) interactions. Subsequently{,}
	dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) is considered as the effective
	dynamics resulting from the Mori-Zwanzig (MZ) projection of the underlying
	atomistic dynamics. The forces between finite-size clusters have{,}
	in general{,} both radial and transverse components and hence we
	employ four different DPD models to account differently for such
	interactions. Quantitative comparisons between these DPD models indicate
	that the DPD models with MZ-guided force fields yield much better
	static and dynamics properties{,} which are consistent with the underlying
	MD system{,} compared to standard DPD with empirical formulae. When
	the rotational motion of the particle is properly taken into account{,}
	the entire velocity autocorrelation function of the MD system as
	well as the pair correlation function can be accurately reproduced
	by the MD-informed DPD model. Since this coarse-graining procedure
	is performed on an unconstrained MD system{,} our framework is general
	and can be used in other soft matter systems in which the clusters
	can be faithfully defined as CG particles.},

  abstract  = {The kinetics of chain exchange between diblock copolymer micelles
	in solution at equilibrium were studied by dissipative particle dynamics
	simulation. We performed hybridization simulations for A2B3 or A4Bx
	(x = 4{,} 6{,} 8) micelle solutions in which approximately half of
	all micelles and free chains were initially colored and chain exchange
	between micelles was monitored by analyzing the time-dependent fraction
	of colored chains in aggregates. We found that in all cases the chain
	exchange is dominated by chain (or small aggregate) expulsion and
	follows a first-order kinetic process with the characteristic time{,}
	[small tau]{,} increasing exponentially with core block length{,}
	NA and interaction parameter between blocks{,} [small chi]AB as [small
	tau] [approximate] exp (0.67[small chi]ABNA). We determined that
	chain exchange between micelles does not depend on concentration
	but occurs via several kinetic mechanisms: unimer expulsion/insertion{,}
	small aggregate fragmentation/merging and unequal size micelle fission/fusion{,}
	which all exhibit very similar relaxation times. Chain exchange between
	micelles in A4Bx micelle solutions is found to occur more rapidly
	for diblock copolymers with a longer corona-block length{,} as the
	area per chain and critical micelle concentration are larger (while
	micelle size and critical micelle temperature are lower) in this
	case{,} implying a lower potential barrier for chain (or small aggregate)
	expulsion from micelles.},

  abstract                   = {{A rnulti-timescale algorithm is proposed for simulating time-dependent
	problems in micro- and nano- fluidics. The total simulation domain
	is spatially decomposed into two regions. Molecular dynamics is employed
	in the crucial interfacial regions and continuum hydrodynamics is
	adopted in the remaining bulk regions. The coupling is through ``constrained
	dynamics{''} in an overlap region. Our time scheme is based on the
	time scale separation between the continuum macro time step and molecular
	micro time step. This allows the molecular dynamics during one macro
	time step to be treated as in quasi-steady state. Therefore, molecular
	simulation is only performed in two shorter time intervals. Through
	linear extrapolation of macroscopic velocities and re-initialization
	of particle configurations, we can significantly reduce the total
	computational cost. We demonstrate and discuss our time algorithm
	through hybrid simulation of channel flow driven by a sinusoidally
	moving top wall. Converging results are achieved for cases of large
	separation of time scale with much less computational cost than with
	the original hybrid simulation without time extrapolation.}},

  abstract  = {An analysis is presented of forces acting on the centers of mass of
	three-armed star polymers in the molten state. The arms consist of
	35 Kremer-Grest beads{,} which is slightly larger than needed for
	one entanglement mass. For a given configuration of the centers of
	mass{,} instantaneous forces fluctuate wildly around averages which
	are two orders of magnitude smaller than their root mean square deviations.
	Average forces are well described by an implicit many-body potential{,}
	while pair models fail completely. The fluctuating forces are modelled
	by means of dynamical variables quantifying the degree of mixing
	of the various polymer pairs. All functions and parameters in a coarse
	grain model based on these concepts are obtained from the underlying
	small scale simulation. The coarse model reproduces both the diffusion
	coefficient and the shear relaxation modulus. Ways to improve the
	model suggest themselves on the basis of our findings.},

	rising in a vertical channel. It is shown that for the particle Reynolds

  abstract = {Density (or state) dependent pair potentials arise naturally from
	coarse-graining procedures in many areas of condensed matter science.
	However, correctly using them to calculate physical properties of
	interest is subtle and cannot be uncoupled from the route by which
	they were derived. Furthermore, there is usually no unique way to
	coarse-grain to an effective pair potential. Even for simple systems
	like liquid argon, the pair potential that correctly reproduces the
	pair structure will not generate the right virial pressure. Ignoring
	these issues in naive applications of density dependent pair potentials
	can lead to an apparent dependence of thermodynamic properties on
	the ensemble within which they are calculated, as well as other inconsistencies.
	These concepts are illustrated by several pedagogical examples, including
	effective pair potentials for systems with many-body interactions,
	and the mapping of charged (Debye–Hückel) and uncharged (Asakura–Oosawa)
	two-component systems onto effective one-component ones. The differences
	between the problems of transferability and representability for
	effective potentials are also discussed.},

  abstract = {The motion of a spherical particle in infinite linear flow and near
	a plane wall, subject to the slip boundary condition on both the
	particle surface and the wall, is studied in the limit of zero Reynolds
	number. In the case of infinite flow, an exact solution is derived
	using the singularity representation, and analytical expressions
	for the force, torque, and stresslet are derived in terms of slip
	coefficients generalizing the Stokes--Basset--Einstein law. The slip
	velocity reduces the drag force, torque, and the effective viscosity
	of a dilute suspension. In the case of wall-bounded flow, advantage
	is taken of the axial symmetry of the boundaries of the flow with
	respect to the axis that is normal to the wall and passes through
	the particle center to formulate the problem in terms of a system
	of one-dimensional integral equations for the first sine and cosine
	Fourier coefficients of the unknown traction and velocity along the
	boundary contour in a meridional plane. Numerical solutions furnish
	accurate predictions for (a) the force and torque exerted on a particle
	translating parallel to the wall in a quiescent fluid, (b) the force
	and torque exerted on a particle rotating about an axis that is parallel
	to the wall in a quiescent fluid, and (c) the translational and angular
	velocities of a freely suspended particle in simple shear flow parallel
	to the wall. For certain combinations of the wall and particle slip
	coefficients, a particle moving under the influence of a tangential
	force translates parallel to the wall without rotation, and a particle
	moving under the influence of a tangential torque rotates about an
	axis that is parallel to the wall without translation. For a particle
	convected in simple shear flow, minimum translational velocity is
	observed for no-slip surfaces. However, allowing for slip may either
	increase or decrease the particle angular velocity, and the dependence
	on the wall and particle slip coefficients is not necessarily monotonic.},

  abstract = {Abstract Smoothed dissipative particle dynamics (SDPD) combines two
	popular mesoscopic techniques, the smoothed particle hydrodynamics
	and dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) methods, and can be considered
	as an improved dissipative particle dynamics approach. Despite several
	advantages of the \{SDPD\} method over the conventional \{DPD\} model,
	the original formulation of \{SDPD\} by Español and Revenga (2003)
	[9], lacks angular momentum conservation, leading to unphysical results
	for problems where the conservation of angular momentum is essential.
	To overcome this limitation, we extend the \{SDPD\} method by introducing
	a particle spin variable such that local and global angular momentum
	conservation is restored. The new \{SDPD\} formulation (SDPD+a) is
	directly derived from the Navier–Stokes equation for fluids with
	spin, while thermal fluctuations are incorporated similarly to the
	\{DPD\} method. We test the new \{SDPD\} method and demonstrate that
	it properly reproduces fluid transport coefficients. Also, \{SDPD\}
	with angular momentum conservation is validated using two problems:
	(i) the Taylor–Couette flow with two immiscible fluids and (ii) a
	tank-treading vesicle in shear flow with a viscosity contrast between
	inner and outer fluids. For both problems, the new \{SDPD\} method
	leads to simulation predictions in agreement with the corresponding
	analytical theories, while the original \{SDPD\} method fails to
	capture properly physical characteristics of the systems due to violation
	of angular momentum conservation. In conclusion, the extended \{SDPD\}
	method with angular momentum conservation provides a new approach
	to tackle fluid problems such as multiphase flows and vesicle/cell
	suspensions, where the conservation of angular momentum is essential.

	state, the q2D confinement results in the coupling of particle motions,

	the final equilibrium state is reached. The process of approaching
	the equilibrium is a random relaxation of a many-body interaction
	system of Brownian particles. As the relaxation proceeds for ∼100
	h, the system reaches the equilibrium state in which the energy gained
	by the particles from the stochastic collision in the whole system
	is counteracted by the dissipative energy resulting from the collision.
	The relaxation time of this stochastic q2D system is 17.7 h. The

  abstract  = {Hybrid simulations of molecular systems{,} which combine all-atom
	(AA) with simplified (or coarse grain{,} CG) representations{,} propose
	an advantageous alternative to gain atomistic details on relevant
	regions while getting profit from the speedup of treating a bigger
	part of the system at the CG level. Here we present a reduced set
	of parameters derived to treat a hybrid interface in DNA simulations.
	Our method allows us to forthrightly link a state-of-the-art force
	field for AA simulations of DNA with a CG representation developed
	by our group. We show that no modification is needed for any of the
	existing residues (neither AA nor CG). Only the bonding parameters
	at the hybrid interface are enough to produce a smooth transition
	of electrostatic{,} mechanic and dynamic features in different AA/CG
	systems{,} which are studied by molecular dynamics simulations using
	an implicit solvent. The simplicity of the approach potentially permits
	us to study the effect of mutations/modifications as well as DNA
	binding molecules at the atomistic level within a significantly larger
	DNA scaffold considered at the CG level. Since all the interactions
	are computed within the same classical Hamiltonian{,} the extension
	to a quantum/classical/coarse-grain multilayer approach using QM/MM
	modules implemented in widely used simulation packages is straightforward.},

	by a suitable choice of some of the model's input parameters the
	code can be used to predict the behaviour of the system in a variety
	of specific applications. However, in any specific application the
	values of necessary parameters may be unknown. In this case, physical
	observations of the system in the specific context are used to learn
	about the unknown parameters. The process of fitting the model to
	the observed data by adjusting the parameters is known as calibration.
	Calibration is typically effected by ad hoc fitting, and after calibration
	the model is used, with the fitted input values, to predict the future
	behaviour of the system. We present a Bayesian calibration technique
	which improves on this traditional approach in two respects. First,
	the predictions allow for all sources of uncertainty, including the
	remaining uncertainty over the fitted parameters. Second, they attempt
	to correct for any inadequacy of the model which is revealed by a
	discrepancy between the observed data and the model predictions from
	even the best-fitting parameter values. The method is illustrated
	by using data from a nuclear radiation release at Tomsk, and from
	a more complex simulated nuclear accident exercise.},

	Abrupt (or discontinuous) shear thickening is found to be a geometric
	rather than hydrodynamic phenomenon; it stems from the strong sensitivity
	of the jamming volume fraction to the nature of contact forces between
	suspended particles. The thickening obtained in a colloidal suspension
	of purely hard frictional spheres is qualitatively similar to experimental
	observations. However, the agreement cannot be made quantitative
	with only hydrodynamics, frictional contacts, and Brownian forces.
	Therefore, the role of a short-range repulsive potential mimicking
	the stabilization of actual suspensions on the thickening is studied.
	The effects of Brownian and repulsive forces on the onset stress
	can be combined in an additive manner. The simulations including
	Brownian and stabilizing forces show excellent agreement with experimental
	data for the viscosity η and the second normal stress difference
	N2.},

Contexts range from the rheology of concentrated suspensions in a viscous fluid to the dynamics of particle-laden turbulent flows. This review summarizes several current approaches to the numerical simulation of rigid particles suspended in a flow, pointing out both common features and differences, along with their primary range of application. The focus is on non-Brownian systems for which thermal fluctuations do not play a role, whereas interparticle forces may result in particle self-assembly. Applications may include the motion of a few isolated particles with complex shape or the collective dynamics of many suspended particles. },

  abstract = {Fractional dynamics has experienced a firm upswing during the past
	few years, having been forged into a mature framework in the theory
	of stochastic processes. A large number of research papers developing
	fractional dynamics further, or applying it to various systems have
	appeared since our first review article on the fractional Fokker–Planck
	equation (Metzler R and Klafter J 2000a, Phys. Rep. 339 1–77). It
	therefore appears timely to put these new works in a cohesive perspective.
	In this review we cover both the theoretical modelling of sub- and
	superdiffusive processes, placing emphasis on superdiffusion, and
	the discussion of applications such as the correct formulation of
	boundary value problems to obtain the first passage time density
	function. We also discuss extensively the occurrence of anomalous
	dynamics in various fields ranging from nanoscale over biological
	to geophysical and environmental systems.},

  abstract = {Fractional kinetic equations of the diffusion, diffusion–advection,
	and Fokker–Planck type are presented as a useful approach for the
	description of transport dynamics in complex systems which are governed
	by anomalous diffusion and non-exponential relaxation patterns. These
	fractional equations are derived asymptotically from basic random
	walk models, and from a generalised master equation. Several physical
	consequences are discussed which are relevant to dynamical processes
	in complex systems. Methods of solution are introduced and for some
	special cases exact solutions are calculated. This report demonstrates
	that fractional equations have come of age as a complementary tool
	in the description of anomalous transport processes. },

	to an electric field. This flow rarely resembles anything like the
	familiar flow of water through a pipe, but three groups describe
	counterexamples (see the Perspective by Zaanen). Moll et al. found
	that the viscosity of the electron fluid in thin wires of PdCoO2
	had a major effect on the flow, much like what happens in regular
	fluids. Bandurin et al. found evidence in graphene of electron whirlpools
	similar to those formed by viscous fluid flowing through a small
	opening. Finally, Crossno et al. observed a huge increase of thermal
	transport in graphene, a signature of so-called Dirac fluids.Science,
	this issue p. 1061, 1055, 1058; see also p. 1026Electron transport
	is conventionally determined by the momentum-relaxing scattering
	of electrons by the host solid and its excitations. Hydrodynamic
	fluid flow through channels, in contrast, is determined partly by
	the viscosity of the fluid, which is governed by momentum-conserving
	internal collisions. A long-standing question in the physics of solids
	has been whether the viscosity of the electron fluid plays an observable
	role in determining the resistance. We report experimental evidence
	that the resistance of restricted channels of the ultrapure two-dimensional
	metal palladium cobaltate (PdCoO2) has a large viscous contribution.
	Comparison with theory allows an estimate of the electronic viscosity
	in the range between 6 {\texttimes} 10{\textendash}3 kg m{\textendash}1

  abstract = {The aim of this paper is to describe a turbulence model for the particle
	method Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). The model makes few
	assumptions, conserves linear and angular momentum, satisfies a discrete
	version of Kelvin’s circulation theorem, and is computationally efficient.
	Furthermore, the results from the model are in good agreement with
	the experimental and computational results of Clercx and Heijst for
	two-dimensional turbulence inside a box with no-slip walls. The model
	is based on a Lagrangian similar to that used for the Lagrangian
	averaged Navier–Stokes (LANS) turbulence model, but with a different
	smoothed velocity. The smoothed velocity preserves the shape of the
	spectrum of the unsmoothed velocity, but reduces the magnitude for
	short length scales by an amount which depends on a parameter ϵ .
	We call this the SPH- ϵ model. The effectiveness of the model is
	indicated by the fact that the second and fourth order velocity correlation
	functions calculated using the smoothed velocity and a coarse resolution,
	are in good agreement with a calculation using a resolution which
	is finer by a factor 2, and therefore requires 8 times as much work
	to integrate to the same time. },

  abstract = {We present experiments and numerical simulations to investigate the
	collective behavior of submicrometer-sized particles immersed in
	a nematic micellar solution. We use latex spheres with diameters
	ranging from 190 to 780 nm and study their aggregation properties
	due to the interplay of the various colloidal forces at work in the
	system. We found that the morphology of aggregates strongly depends
	on the particle size, with evidence for two distinct regimes: the
	biggest inclusions clump together within minutes into either compact
	clusters or V-like structures that are completely consistent with
	attractive elastic interactions. On the contrary, the smallest particles
	form chains elongated along the nematic axis, within comparable timescales.
	In this regime, Monte Carlo simulations, based on a modified diffusion-limited
	cluster aggregation model, strongly suggest that the anisotropic
	rotational Brownian motion of the clusters combined with short-range
	depletion interactions dominate the system coarsening; elastic interactions
	no longer prevail. The simulations reproduce the sharp transition
	between the two regimes on increasing the particle size. We provide
	reasonable estimates to interpret our data and propose a likely scenario
	for colloidal aggregation. These results emphasize the growing importance
	of the diffusion of species at suboptical-wavelength scales and raise
	a number of fundamental issues.},

	using a smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulation that is coupled
	at each fluid element to microscopic simulators that can accurately
	account for the dynamics of entangled polymers. The multiscale simulation
	is used to investigate the flow of an entangled polymer melt around
	a cylindrical obstacle subject to periodic boundary conditions. It
	is found that the macroscopic flow behavior is dependent on the history
	of the microscopic states of the polymers and that this memory causes
	nonlinear behavior even in the regions where the local Weissenberg
	number defined using the local strain-rate is less than unity. The
	spatial distribution of the entanglements ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lang.gif]

	suggests that, in a region around the obstacle, a slight depletion
	of the entanglements is observed and that this region broadens along

  abstract = {For several centuries fluid dynamics studies have relied upon the
	assumption that when a liquid flows over a solid surface, the liquid
	molecules adjacent to the solid are stationary relative to the solid.
	This no-slip boundary condition (BC) has been applied successfully
	to model many macroscopic experiments, but has no microscopic justification.
	In recent years there has been an increased interest in determining
	the appropriate BCs for the flow of Newtonian liquids in confined
	geometries, partly due to exciting developments in the fields of
	microfluidic and microelectromechanical devices and partly because
	new and more sophisticated measurement techniques are now available.
	An increasing number of research groups now dedicate great attention
	to the study of the flow of liquids at solid interfaces, and as a
	result a large number of experimental, computational and theoretical
	studies have appeared in the literature. We provide here a review
	of experimental studies regarding the phenomenon of slip of Newtonian
	liquids at solid interfaces. We dedicate particular attention to
	the effects that factors such as surface roughness, wettability and
	the presence of gaseous layers might have on the measured interfacial
	slip. We also discuss how future studies might improve our understanding
	of hydrodynamic BCs and enable us to actively control liquid slip.},

  title    = {Adaptive Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics: Methodology. II.},
  journal  = {The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series},
  year     = {1998},
  volume   = {116},
  number   = {2},
  pages    = {155},
  abstract = {Further development and additional details and tests of adaptive smoothed
	particle hydrodynamics (ASPH), the new version of smoothed particle
	hydrodynamics (SPH) described in the first paper in this series (Shapiro
	et al.), are presented. The ASPH method replaces the isotropic smoothing
	algorithm of standard SPH, in which interpolation is performed with
	spherical kernels of radius given by a scalar smoothing length, with
	anisotropic smoothing involving ellipsoidal kernels and tensor smoothing
	lengths. In standard SPH, the smoothing length for each particle
	represents the spatial resolution scale in the vicinity of that particle
	and is typically allowed to vary in space and time so as to reflect
	the local value of the mean interparticle spacing. This isotropic
	approach is not optimal, however, in the presence of strongly anisotropic
	volume changes such as occur naturally in a wide range of astrophysical
	flows, including gravitational collapse, cosmological structure formation,
	cloud-cloud collisions, and radiative shocks. In such cases, the
	local mean interparticle spacing varies not only in time and space
	but also in direction as well. This problem is remedied in ASPH,
	where each axis of the ellipsoidal smoothing kernel for a given particle
	is adjusted so as to reflect the different mean interparticle spacings
	along different directions in the vicinity of that particle. By deforming
	and rotating these ellipsoidal kernels so as to follow the anisotropy
	of volume changes local to each particle, ASPH adapts its spatial
	resolution scale in time, space, and direction. This significantly
	improves the spatial resolving power of the method over that of standard
	SPH at fixed particle number per simulation. This paper presents
	an alternative formulation of the ASPH algorithm for evolving anisotropic
	smoothing kernels, in which the geometric approach of the first paper
	in this series, based upon the Lagrangian deformation of ellipsoidal
	fluid elements surrounding each particle, is replaced by an approach
	involving a local transformation of coordinates to those in which
	the underlying anisotropic volume changes appear to be isotropic.
	Using this formulation the ASPH method is presented in two and three
	dimensions, including a number of details not previously included
	in the earlier paper, some of which represent either advances or
	different choices with respect to the ASPH method detailed in the
	earlier paper. Among the advances included here are an asynchronous
	time-integration scheme with different time steps for different particles
	and the generalization of the ASPH method to three dimensions. In
	the category of different choices, the shock-tracking algorithm described
	in the earlier paper for locally adapting the artificial viscosity
	to restrict viscous heating just to particles encountering shocks
	is not included here. Instead, we adopt a different interpolation
	kernel for use with the artificial viscosity, which has the effect
	of spatially localizing effects of the artificial viscosity. This
	version of the ASPH method in two and three dimensions is then applied
	to a series of one-, two-, and three-dimensional test problems, and
	the results are compared to those of standard SPH applied to the
	same problems. These include the problem of cosmological pancake
	collapse, the Riemann shock tube, cylindrical and spherical Sedov
	blast waves, the collision of two strong shocks, and problems involving
	shearing disks intended to test the angular momentum conservation
	properties of the method. These results further support the idea
	that ASPH has significantly better resolving power than standard
	SPH for a wide range of problems, including that of cosmological
	structure formation.},

  journal  = {Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences},
  year     = {2014},
  abstract = {At the molecular scale, there are strong attractive interactions between
	surfaces, yet few macroscopic surfaces are sticky. Extensive simulations
	of contact by adhesive surfaces with roughness on nanometer to micrometer
	scales are used to determine how roughness reduces the area where
	atoms contact and thus weakens adhesion. The material properties,
	adhesive strength, and roughness parameters are varied by orders
	of magnitude. In all cases, the area of atomic contact is initially
	proportional to the load. The prefactor rises linearly with adhesive
	strength for weak attractions. Above a threshold adhesive strength,
	the prefactor changes sign, the surfaces become sticky, and a finite
	force is required to separate them. A parameter-free analytic theory
	is presented that describes changes in these numerical results over
	up to five orders of magnitude in load. It relates the threshold
	adhesive strength to roughness and material properties, explaining
	why most macroscopic surfaces do not stick. The numerical results
	are qualitatively and quantitatively inconsistent with classical
	theories based on the Greenwood−Williamson approach that neglect
	the range of adhesion and do not include asperity interactions.},

	and the cytoskeleton in a red blood cell (RBC) by developing a general
	framework for mesoscopic simulations. We treated the lipid bilayer
	and the cytoskeleton as two distinct components and developed a unique
	whole-cell model of the RBC, using dissipative particle dynamics
	(DPD). The model is validated by comparing the predicted results
	with measurements from four different and independent experiments.
	First, we simulated the micropipette aspiration and quantified the
	cytoskeletal deformation. Second, we studied the membrane fluctuations
	of healthy RBCs and RBCs parasitized to different intraerythrocytic
	stages by the malaria-inducing parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Third,
	we subjected the RBC to shear flow and investigated the dependence
	of its tank-treading frequency on shear rate. Finally, we simulated
	the bilayer–cytoskeletal detachment in channel flow to quantify the
	strength of such interactions when the corresponding bonds break.
	Taken together, these experiments and corresponding systematic DPD
	simulations probe the governing constitutive response of the cytoskeleton,
	elastic stiffness, viscous friction, and strength of bilayer–cytoskeletal
	interactions as well as membrane viscosities. Hence, the DPD simulations
	and comparisons with available independent experiments serve as validation
	of the unique two-component model and lead to useful insights into
	the biomechanical interactions between the lipid bilayer and the
	cytoskeleton of the RBC. Furthermore, they provide a basis for further
	studies to probe cell mechanistic processes in health and disease
	in a manner that guides the design and interpretation of experiments
	and to develop simulations of phenomena that cannot be studied systematically
	by experiments alone.},

	has the same form over a long range as the fractional extension versus
	force applied at the ends of a worm-like chain. For small deformations
	(< 30 percent of full extension), the extension increases with velocity
	as x approximately v0.70 +/- 0.08. The relative size of fluctuations

	require models which cover these scales and the respective levels
	of resolution. Multiscale simulation methods combine and systematically
	link several simulation hierarchies so that they can address phenomena
	at multiple levels of resolution. In order to reach the mesoscopic
	time- and length-scales important for many material properties{,}
	methods that bridge from the atomistic (microscopic) to a coarser
	(mesocopic) level are developed. Here{,} we review coarse-grained
	simulation models that are linked to a higher resolution atomistic
	description. In particular{,} we focus on structure-based coarse-graining
	methods which are used for a variety of soft matter problems - ranging
	from structure-formation in amorphous polymers to biomolecular aggregation.
	It is shown that by coarse-grained simulation in combination with
	an efficient backmapping methodology one can obtain well-equilibrated
	long time- and large length-scale atomistic structures of polymeric
	melts or biomolecular aggregates which can be used for comparison
	to experimental data. Methodological aspects are addressed such as
	the question of the time-scales and dynamics in the different simulation
	hierarchies and an outlook to future challenges in the area of resolution
	exchange approaches and adaptive resolution models is presented.},

	(dissipative particle dynamics) are usually very sensitive to the

	this sensitivity by considering the irreversible dynamics in DPD
	as the limiting case of a thermostat that leaves Maxwell-Boltzmann
	distribution invariant even for finite time steps. The remaining
	dependency on time step is solely due to the discretization of the
	conservative part of the dynamics and is independent of the thermostat.},

	stated, the standard rigid TIP3P model [ 3 [#ref1] ] with a 104.52°
	H-O-H angle. All the other parameters are the same as in the standard
	rigid TIP3P water model. The statistical properties of similarly
	modified water models have been studied by other authors, cf references
	[ 4–6 [#ref1] ] . Since in the adaptive resolution simulations reported
	in references [ 1, 2 [#ref1] ] the modified TIP3P all-atom water
	model was studied in combination with the appropriate coarse-grained
	model, all conclusions of the paper concerning the adaptive resolution
	simulation remain unaltered. References [1] Praprotnik M, Matysiak

  abstract = {Water plays a central role in biological systems and processes, and
	is equally relevant in a large range of industrial and technological
	applications. Being the most important natural solvent, its presence
	uniquely influences biological function as well as technical processes.
	Because of their importance, aqueous solutions are among the most
	experimentally and theoretically studied systems. However, many questions
	still remain open. Both experiments and theoretical models are usually
	restricted to specific cases. In particular all-atom simulations
	of biomolecules and materials in water are computationally very expensive
	and often not possible, mainly due to the computational effort to
	obtain water–water interactions in regions not relevant for the problem
	under consideration. In this paper we present a coarse-grained model
	that can reproduce the behaviour of liquid water at a standard temperature
	and pressure remarkably well. The model is then used in a multiscale
	simulation of liquid water, where a spatially adaptive molecular
	resolution procedure allows one to change from a coarse-grained to
	an all-atom representation on-the-fly. We show that this approach
	leads to the correct description of essential thermodynamic and structural
	properties of liquid water. Our adaptive multiscale scheme allows
	for significantly greater extensive simulations than existing approaches
	by taking explicit water into account only in the regions where the
	atomistic details are physically relevant.},

  abstract = {Microrheology was proposed almost twenty years ago as a technique
	to obtain rheological properties in soft matter from the microscopic
	motion of colloidal tracers used as probes, either freely diffusing
	in the host medium, or subjected to external forces. The former case
	is known as passive microrheology , and is based on generalizations
	of the Stokes–Einstein relation between the friction experienced
	by the probe and the host-fluid viscosity. The latter is termed active
	microrheology , and extends the measurement of the friction coefficient
	to the nonlinear-response regime of strongly driven probes. In this
	review article, we discuss theoretical models available in the literature
	for both passive and active microrheology, focusing on the case of
	single-probe motion in model colloidal host media. A brief overview
	of the theory of passive microrheology is given, starting from the
	work of Mason and Weitz. Further developments include refined models
	of the host suspension beyond that of a Newtonian-fluid continuum,
	and the investigation of probe-size effects. Active microrheology
	is described starting from microscopic equations of motion for the
	whole system including both the host-fluid particles and the tracer;
	the many-body Smoluchowski equation for the case of colloidal suspensions.
	At low fluid densities, this can be simplified to a two-particle
	equation that allows the calculation of the friction coefficient
	with the input of the density distribution around the tracer, as
	shown by Brady and coworkers. The results need to be upscaled to
	agree with simulations at moderate density, in both the case of pulling
	the tracer with a constant force or dragging it at a constant velocity.
	The full many-particle equation has been tackled by Fuchs and coworkers,
	using a mode-coupling approximation and the scheme of integration
	through transients, valid at high densities. A localization transition
	is predicted for a probe embedded in a glass-forming host suspension.
	The nonlinear probe-friction coefficient is calculated from the tracer's
	position correlation function. Computer simulations show qualitative
	agreement with the theory, but also some unexpected features, such
	as superdiffusive motion of the probe related to the breaking of
	nearest-neighbor cages. We conclude with some perspectives and future
	directions of theoretical models of microrheology.},

	finite slip at hydrophobic walls on the hydrodynamics and{,} consequently{,}
	on the dynamics of the DNA in microchannels. We use dissipative particle
	dynamics to study DNA transport as a function of chain length and
	the Reynolds number in two dimensional parallel plate channels. We
	show how an asymmetric velocity profile in a channel with hydrophobic
	and hydrophilic walls can be used to manipulate the location of the
	DNA molecules. Using this effect{,} we propose a simple arrangement
	of hydrophobic and hydrophilic strips which can be exploited to separate
	long and short DNA chains.},

  abstract = {Standard formulations of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) are
	unable to resolve mixing at fluid boundaries. We use an error and
	stability analysis of the generalized SPH equations of motion to
	prove that this is due to two distinct problems. The first is a leading
	order error in the momentum equation. This should decrease with an
	increasing neighbour number, but does not because numerical instabilities
	cause the kernel to be irregularly sampled. We identify two important
	instabilities: the clumping instability and the banding instability,
	and we show that both are cured by a suitable choice of kernel. The
	second problem is the local mixing instability (LMI). This occurs
	as particles attempt to mix on the kernel scale, but are unable to
	due to entropy conservation. The result is a pressure discontinuity
	at boundaries that pushes fluids of different entropies apart. We
	cure the LMI by using a weighted density estimate that ensures that
	pressures are single-valued throughout the flow. This also gives
	a better volume estimate for the particles, reducing errors in the
	continuity and momentum equations. We demonstrate mixing in our new
	optimized smoothed particle hydrodynamics (OSPH) scheme using a Kelvin–Helmholtz
	instability (KHI) test with a density contrast of 1:2, and the ‘blob
	test’– a 1:10 density ratio gas sphere in a wind tunnel – finding
	excellent agreement between OSPH and Eulerian codes.},

  abstract  = {Colloidal suspensions are often argued to be an ideal model for studying
	phase transitions such as crystallization{,} as they have the advantage
	of tunable interactions and experimentally tractable time and length
	scales. Because crystallization is assumed to be unaffected by details
	of particle transport other than the bulk diffusion coefficient{,}
	findings are frequently argued to be transferable to pure melts without
	solvent. In this article{,} we present molecular dynamics simulations
	of crystallization in a suspension of colloids with Yukawa interactions
	which challenge this assumption. In order to investigate the role
	of hydrodynamic interactions mediated by the solvent{,} we model
	the solvent both implicitly and explicitly{,} using Langevin dynamics
	and the fluctuating lattice Boltzmann method{,} respectively. Our
	simulations show a significant reduction of the crystal growth velocity
	due to hydrodynamic interactions even at moderate hydrodynamic coupling.
	This slowdown is accompanied by a reduction of the width of the layering
	region in front of the growing crystal. Thus the dynamics of a colloidal
	suspension differ strongly from that of a melt{,} making it less
	useful as a model for solvent-free melts than previously thought.},

  abstract = {Stochastic thermodynamics as reviewed here systematically provides
	a framework for extending the notions of classical thermodynamics
	such as work, heat and entropy production to the level of individual
	trajectories of well-defined non-equilibrium ensembles. It applies
	whenever a non-equilibrium process is still coupled to one (or several)
	heat bath(s) of constant temperature. Paradigmatic systems are single
	colloidal particles in time-dependent laser traps, polymers in external
	flow, enzymes and molecular motors in single molecule assays, small
	biochemical networks and thermoelectric devices involving single
	electron transport. For such systems, a first-law like energy balance
	can be identified along fluctuating trajectories. For a basic Markovian
	dynamics implemented either on the continuum level with Langevin
	equations or on a discrete set of states as a master equation, thermodynamic
	consistency imposes a local-detailed balance constraint on noise
	and rates, respectively. Various integral and detailed fluctuation
	theorems, which are derived here in a unifying approach from one
	master theorem, constrain the probability distributions for work,
	heat and entropy production depending on the nature of the system
	and the choice of non-equilibrium conditions. For non-equilibrium
	steady states, particularly strong results hold like a generalized
	fluctuation–dissipation theorem involving entropy production. Ramifications
	and applications of these concepts include optimal driving between
	specified states in finite time, the role of measurement-based feedback
	processes and the relation between dissipation and irreversibility.
	Efficiency and, in particular, efficiency at maximum power can be
	discussed systematically beyond the linear response regime for two
	classes of molecular machines, isothermal ones such as molecular
	motors, and heat engines such as thermoelectric devices, using a
	common framework based on a cycle decomposition of entropy production.},

	questions in the fields of biology, chemistry, and medicine. A wide
	range of biologically interesting phenomena, however, occur over
	timescales on the order of a millisecond - several orders of magnitude
	beyond the duration of the longest current MD simulations. We describe
	a massively parallel machine called Anton, which should be capable
	of executing millisecond-scale classical MD simulations of such biomolecular
	systems. The machine, which is scheduled for completion by the end
	of 2008, is based on 512 identical MD-specific ASICs that interact
	in a tightly coupled manner using a specialized highspeed communication
	network. Anton has been designed to use both novel parallel algorithms
	and special-purpose logic to dramatically accelerate those calculations
	that dominate the time required for a typical MD simulation. The
	remainder of the simulation algorithm is executed by a programmable
	portion of each chip that achieves a substantial degree of parallelism
	while preserving the flexibility necessary to accommodate anticipated
	advances in physical models and simulation methods.}},

	of a field function in Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics is proposed.
	The algorithm is based on the solution, at each particle location,
	of a linear system whose unknowns are the first three derivatives
	of the desired function; the coefficients of the linear system are
	obtained from various possible particle approximations of the Taylor
	series expansion of the function. The method proves to be 2nd-order
	consistent for the 1st derivatives and 1st-order consistent for the
	2nd derivatives, both inside the domain and close to the boundaries,
	and it is not affected by an irregular particle distribution. A numerical
	test performed on the \{SPH\} solution of the viscous Burgers equation
	proves that the method can be validly applied to the simulation of
	convection–diffusion problems. },

  abstract = {We present a model for star formation and supernova feedback that
	describes the multiphase structure of star-forming gas on scales
	that are typically not resolved in cosmological simulations. Our
	approach includes radiative heating and cooling, the growth of cold
	clouds embedded in an ambient hot medium, star formation in these
	clouds, feedback from supernovae in the form of thermal heating and
	cloud evaporation, galactic winds and outflows, and metal enrichment.
	Implemented using smoothed particle hydrodynamics, our scheme is
	a significantly modified and extended version of the grid-based method
	of Yepes et al., and enables us to achieve a high dynamic range in
	simulations of structure formation.We discuss properties of the feedback
	model in detail and show that it predicts a self-regulated, quiescent
	mode of star formation, which, in particular, stabilizes the star-forming
	gaseous layers of disc galaxies. The parametrization of this mode
	can be reduced to a single free quantity that determines the overall
	time-scale for star formation. We fix this parameter numerically
	to match the observed rates of star formation in local disc galaxies.
	When normalized in this manner, cosmological simulations employing
	our model nevertheless overproduce the observed cosmic abundance
	of stellar material. We are thus motivated to extend our feedback
	model to include galactic winds associated with star formation.Using
	small-scale simulations of individual star-forming disc galaxies,
	we show that these winds produce either galactic fountains or outflows,
	depending on the depth of the gravitational potential. In low-mass
	haloes, winds can greatly suppress the overall efficiency of star
	formation. When incorporated into cosmological simulations, our combined
	model for star formation and winds predicts a cosmic star formation
	density that is consistent with observations, provided that the winds
	are sufficiently energetic. Moreover, outflows from galaxies in these
	simulations drive chemical enrichment of the intergalactic medium
	— in principle, accounting for the presence of metals in the Lyman
	α forest.},

  abstract = {We discuss differences in simulation results that arise between the
	use of either the thermal energy or the entropy as an independent
	variable in smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). In this context,
	we derive a new version of SPH that, when appropriate, manifestly
	conserves both energy and entropy if smoothing lengths are allowed
	to adapt freely to the local mass resolution. To test various formulations
	of SPH, we consider point-like energy injection, as in certain models
	of supernova feedback, and find that powerful explosions are well
	represented by SPH even when the energy is deposited into a single
	particle, provided that the entropy equation is integrated. If the
	thermal energy is instead used as an independent variable, unphysical
	solutions can be obtained for this problem.We also examine the radiative
	cooling of gas spheres that collapse and virialize in isolation,
	and of haloes that form in cosmological simulations of structure
	formation. When applied to these problems, the thermal energy version
	of SPH leads to substantial overcooling in haloes that are resolved
	with up to a few thousand particles, while the entropy formulation
	is biased only moderately low for these haloes under the same circumstances.
	For objects resolved with much larger particle numbers, the two approaches
	yield consistent results. We trace the origin of the differences
	to systematic resolution effects in the outer parts of cooling flows.
	When the thermal energy equation is integrated and the resolution
	is low, the compressional heating of the gas in the inflow region
	is underestimated, violating entropy conservation and improperly
	accelerating cooling.The cumulative effect of this overcooling can
	be significant. In cosmological simulations of moderate size, we
	find that the fraction of baryons which cool and condense can be
	reduced by up to a factor ∼2 if the entropy equation is employed
	rather than the thermal energy equation, partly explaining discrepancies
	with semi-analytic treatments of galaxy formation. We also demonstrate
	that the entropy method leads to a greatly reduced scatter in the
	density–temperature relation of the low-density Lyα forest relative
	to the thermal energy approach, in accord with theoretical expectations.},

	systems, constructing an accurate reduced model is prohibitively
	expensive. The main difficulty stems from the tremendous range of
	spatial and temporal scales present in the solution of such systems.
	This leads to the need to develop reduced models where, inevitably,
	the resolved variables do not exhibit (spatial and/or temporal) scale

	conditions, flows in these channels are laminar—the spontaneous fluctuations
	of velocity that tend to homogenize fluids in turbulent flows are
	absent, and molecular diffusion across the channels is slow. We present
	a passive method for mixing streams of steady pressure-driven flows
	in microchannels at low Reynolds number. Using this method, the length
	of the channel required for mixing grows only logarithmically with
	the Péclet number, and hydrodynamic dispersion along the channel
	is reduced relative to that in a simple, smooth channel. This method
	uses bas-relief structures on the floor of the channel that are easily
	fabricated with commonly used methods of planar lithography.},

	methods that have surfaced in the field of fluid mechanics over the
	last 20 years. We consider five established particle methods: molecular
	dynamics, direct simulation Monte Carlo, lattice Boltzmann method,
	dissipative particle dynamics and smoothed-particle hydrodynamics.
	A general description is given on each particle method in conjunction
	with multiscale and hybrid applications. An analysis on the length
	scale separation revealed that current multiscale methods only bridge
	across scales which are of the order of \$\$\{{\backslash}mathcal
	\{O\}\}(10^2) \{-\} \{{\backslash}mathcal \{O\}\}(10^3)\$\$ O ( 10
	2 ) - O ( 10 3 ) and that further work on complex geometries and
	parallel code optimisation is needed to increase the separation.
	Similarities between methods are highlighted and combinations discussed.
	Advantages, disadvantages and applications of each particle method
	have been tabulated as a reference.},

	The PDE dynamic behavior can be probed through direct simulation

	Method [Shroff, G. M. & Keller, H. B. (1993) SIAM J. Numer. Anal.

	demonstrate an adaptation of this approach that allows for a direct,

	models; this is illustrated through a comparative study of the FitzHugh-Nagumo
	PDE and of a corresponding Lattice–Boltzmann model.},

	in a Newtonian fluid is presented. The solvent is modeled with smoothed
	particle hydrodynamics method, which takes into account exactly the
	long-range multi-body hydrodynamic interactions between suspended
	spheres. Short-range lubrication forces which are necessary to simulate
	concentrated suspensions, are introduced pair-wisely based on the
	analytical solution of Stokes equations for approaching/departing
	objects. Given that lubrication is singular at vanishing solid particle
	separations, an implicit splitting integration scheme is used to
	obtain accurate results and at the same time to avoid prohibitively
	small simulation time steps. Hydrodynamic interactions between solid
	particles, at both long-range and short-range limits, are verified
	against theory in the case of two approaching spheres in a quiescent
	medium and under bulk shear flow, where good agreements are obtained.
	Finally, numerical results for the suspension viscosity of a many-particle
	system are shown and compared with analytical solutions available
	in the dilute and semi-dilute case as well as with previous numerical
	results obtained in the concentrated limit.},

	a particle and a continuum system which reside in two slightly overlapping
	volumes in space. The scheme ensures conservation of mass, momentum
	and energy between a system of Lennard–Jones particles and a continuum
	description given by the compressible Navier–Stokes equations. An
	implementation in two dimensions employing the compressible Navier—Stokes
	equations to describe the continuum, and the Lennard–Jones potential
	to describe the particles, is discussed. The accuracy of the coupling
	scheme is tested successfully for the case of homogeneous flow and
	discussed for the more general case.},

  abstract = {We perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the hydrophobic–hydrophilic
	behavior of pairs of \{C60\} fullerene molecules and single wall
	carbon nanotubes in water. The interaction potentials involve a fully
	atomistic description of the fullerenes or carbon nanotubes and the
	water is modeled using the flexible \{SPC\} model. Both unconstrained
	and constrained \{MD\} simulations are carried out. We find that
	these systems display drying, as evidenced by expulsion of the interstitial
	water, when the \{C60\} and carbon nanotubes are separated by less
	than 12, and 9–10 Å, respectively. From the constrained simulations,
	the computed mean force between two carbon nanotubes in water exhibits
	a maximum at a tube spacing of 5.0 Å which corresponds to approximately
	one unstable layer of interstitial water molecules. The main contribution
	to the force stems from the van der Waals attraction between the
	carbon surfaces. The minimum in the potential of mean force has a
	value of −17 kJ&#xa0;mol−1&#xa0;Å−1 at a tube spacing of 3.5 Å. },

	formalism by considering the deterministic Navier–Stokes equation
	with Gaussian random initial data. A unique critical Reynolds number,
	Rec≈2,332, at which the probability of observing puffs in the solution
	changes from 0 to 1, is numerically demonstrated to exist in the
	thermodynamic limit and is found to be independent of the noise amplitude.
	Using the puff density as the macrostate variable, the free energy
	of such a system is computed and analyzed. The puff density approaches
	zero as the critical Reynolds number is approached from above, signaling
	a continuous transition despite the fact that the bifurcation is
	subcritical for a finite-sized system. An action function is found
	for the probability of observing puffs in a small subregion of the
	flow, and this action function depends only on the Reynolds number.
	The strategy used here should be applicable to a wide range of other
	problems exhibiting subcritical instabilities.},

	transition was approached, in agreement with computer simulations;
	at the glass transition, however, there was a sudden drop in their

	also present, albeit with a markedly different nature, at shorter

	slip boundary condition. By using the Fourier series expansion in

	and is shown to include some existing known results as special cases.
	By analysing the exact solution, it is found that the influences
	of boundary slip on the flow behaviour are qualitatively different
	for different types of pressure fields driving the flow. For pressure
	fields with a constant pressure gradient, the flow rate increases
	with the increase in the slip parameter l almost linearly when l
	is large; while, for pressure fields with a wave form pressure gradient
	within a certain frequency range, as the slip parameter l increases,
	the amplitude of the flow rate increases first and then approaches
	a constant value when l becomes sufficiently large. It is also found
	that to achieve a given flow rate, one could have different designs
	and the graphs for the design are presented and discussed in this

	method, as well as methods with finite interface thickness such as

	equations and related issues are discussed. Methods and models for
	surface tension forces, contact lines, heat and mass transfer and
	phase change are presented. In the second part of this article applications

  abstract = {When a blood vessel ruptures or gets inflamed, the human body responds
	by rapidly forming a clot to restrict the loss of blood. Platelets
	aggregation at the injury site of the blood vessel occurring via
	platelet–platelet adhesion, tethering and rolling on the injured
	endothelium is a critical initial step in blood clot formation. A
	novel three-dimensional multi-scale model is introduced and used
	in this paper to simulate receptor-mediated adhesion of deformable
	platelets at the site of vascular injury under different shear rates
	of blood flow. The novelty of the model is based on a new approach
	of coupling submodels at three biological scales crucial for the
	early clot formation: novel hybrid cell membrane submodel to represent
	physiological elastic properties of a platelet, stochastic receptor–ligand
	binding submodel to describe cell adhesion kinetics and lattice Boltzmann
	submodel for simulating blood flow. The model implementation on the
	GPU cluster significantly improved simulation performance. Predictive
	model simulations revealed that platelet deformation, interactions
	between platelets in the vicinity of the vessel wall as well as the
	number of functional GPIbα platelet receptors played significant
	roles in platelet adhesion to the injury site. Variation of the number
	of functional GPIbα platelet receptors as well as changes of platelet
	stiffness can represent effects of specific drugs reducing or enhancing
	platelet activity. Therefore, predictive simulations can improve
	the search for new drug targets and help to make treatment of thrombosis
	patient-specific.},

	The most common interpretation of these phenomena identifies layering

	the observed behavior. However, studies of the particle configurations
	associated with shear thinning and thickening cast doubt on that
	conclusion and leave unsettled whether these nonequilibrium phenomena
	are caused primarily by correlated particle motions or by changes
	in particle packing structure. We report the results of Stokesian
	dynamics simulations of suspensions of hard spheres that illuminate
	the relation among the suspension viscosity, shear rate, and particle
	configuration. Using a recently introduced sampling technique for
	nonequilibrium systems, we show that shear thinning can be decoupled
	from layering, thereby eliminating layering as the driver for shear
	thinning. In contrast, we find that there is a strong correlation
	between shear thinning and a two-particle measure of the shear stress.
	Our results are consistent with a recent experimental study.},

  abstract = {Abstract Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), as a Lagrangian meshfree
	particle method, has been applied to modeling viscous liquid drop
	with surface tension and wetting dynamics. In the \{SPH\} model,
	the van der Waals (vdW) equation of state is usually used to describe
	the gas-to-liquid phase transition similar to that of a real fluid.
	However, the attractive forces between \{SPH\} particles originated
	from the cohesive pressure of the vdW equation of state can lead
	to tensile instability, which is associated with unphysical phenomena
	such as particle clustering or blowing away. This paper presents
	an improved \{SPH\} method for modeling viscous liquid drop. The
	inherent tensile instability in \{SPH\} is removed by using a hyperbolic-shaped
	kernel function which possesses non-negative second derivatives.
	A single-step approximation for heat flux is used in modeling viscous
	liquid drop with smoother temperature field. The formations of viscous
	liquid drops, both in 2D and 3D, are tested and it clearly demonstrates
	that the tensile instability can be effectively removed. The improved
	\{SPH\} method is also used to model two other numerical examples
	including the oscillation and binary collision of liquid drops without
	tensile instability. },

	suspensions in a Couette flow. The channel is divided into four zones
	based on the suspension microstructure and variances of the wall-normal
	and spanwise displacements for the particles in each zone. Due to
	the strong spatial coherency induced by the density fluctuations,
	the suspended particles exhibit anomalous diffusion. The diffusion
	in the wall-normal direction changes from superdiffusion for the
	particles next to the wall to subdiffusion for the particles near
	the core of the channel. It seems that the intermittent jumps and
	particle entrapment in particle layers are responsible for the anomalous
	diffusion near the wall, while the subdiffusion in the core is related
	to the overall confinement by the channel walls. Copyright (C) EPLA,

	in a Newtonian fluid was characterized by independent measurements
	in viscometric flows. Using a suspension balance formulation, the
	normal stress in the vorticity direction (Sigma(33)) for a suspension
	undergoing simple shear was extracted from Acrivos et al.'s {[}Int.
	J. Multiphase Flow 19, 797 (1993)] resuspension data in a Couette
	device. Employing a new correlation for the relative viscosity mu(r)
	which obeys the Einstein relation in the dilute limit while diverging
	at random close packing, it was found that Sigma(33)/tau (where tau
	is the magnitude of the shear stress) was a strong function of the
	solid volume fraction phi, scaling as phi(3)e(2.34 phi). The relative
	viscosity, measured in a parallel plate viscometer, was in good agreement
	with the proposed correlation, while the normal stress differences
	N-1 and N-2 for concentrated suspensions (phi = 0.30-0.55) were characterized
	using parallel plate and cone-and-plate geometries, as well as laser
	profilometry measurements of the suspension surface deflection in
	a rotating rod geometry. The normal stresses were proportional to
	the shear stress tau, and with beta = N-1/tau and delta = N-2/tau,
	the parameter combinations resulting from the three experimental
	geometries, beta- delta, beta, and delta+1/2 beta, were all seen
	to increase with phi according to the derived scaling phi(3)e(2.34
	phi). Furthermore, the best-fit N-1 and N-2 values consistent with
	the set of experiments were both negative, with \textbackslash{}N-2\textbackslash{}
	> \textbackslash{}N-1\textbackslash{} at any given concentration
	and shear rate. Taken together, the results obtained allow a complete
	determination of the total stress of a sheared suspension and in
	particular enabled us to compute the shear-induced particle-phase
	pressure Pi, as defined in jeffrey et al. (C) 2000 The Society of

	and strength of interactions. Geometrical constraints imply that
	a compact cluster can copy itself only with help of a catalyst, a
	smaller cluster that increases the surface area to form a template.
	Replication efficiency requires optimizing interaction energies to
	destabilize all kinetic traps along the reaction pathway, as well
	as initiating a trigger event that specifies when the new cluster
	disassociates from its parent. Although there is a reasonably wide
	parameter range for self-replication, there is a subtle balance between
	the speed of the reaction, and the error rate. As a proof of principle,
	we construct interactions that self-replicate an octahedron, requiring
	a two-particle dimer for a catalyst. The resulting self-replication
	scheme is a hypercycle, and computer simulations confirm the exponential
	growth of both octahedron and catalyst replicas.},

  abstract = {We establish size limitations for assembling structures of controlled
	size and shape out of colloidal particles with short-ranged interactions.
	Through simulations we show that structures with highly variable
	shapes made out of dozens of particles can form with high yield,
	as long as each particle in the structure binds only to the particles
	in their local environment. To understand this, we identify the excited
	states that compete with the ground-state structure and demonstrate
	that these excited states have a completely topological characterization,
	valid when the interparticle interactions are short-ranged. This
	allows complete enumeration of the energy landscape and gives bounds
	on how large a colloidal structure can assemble with high yield.
	For large structures the yield can be significant, even with hundreds
	of particles.},

We show that such an approximation can be constructed to arbitrarily high order and the resulting generalized Langevin dynamics can be embedded in an extended stochastic model without explicit memory. We demonstrate how to introduce the stochastic noise so that the second fluctuation-dissipation theorem is exactly satisfied. Results from several numerical tests are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract = {A ubiquitous example of fluid mixing is the Rayleigh–Taylor instability, in which a heavy fluid initially sits atop a light fluid in a gravitational field. The subsequent development of the unstable interface between the two fluids is marked by several stages. At first, each interface mode grows exponentially with time before transitioning to a nonlinear regime characterized by more complex hydrodynamic mixing. Unfortunately, traditional continuum modeling of this process has generally been in poor agreement with experiment. Here, we indicate that the natural, random fluctuations of the flow field present in any fluid, which are neglected in continuum models, can lead to qualitatively and quantitatively better agreement with experiment. We performed billion-particle atomistic simulations and magnetic levitation experiments with unprecedented control of initial interface conditions. A comparison between our simulations and experiments reveals good agreement in terms of the growth rate of the mixing front as well as the new observation of droplet breakup at later times. These results improve our understanding of many fluid processes, including interface phenomena that occur, for example, in supernovae, the detachment of droplets from a faucet, and ink jet printing. Such instabilities are also relevant to the possible energy source of inertial confinement fusion, in which a millimeter-sized capsule is imploded to initiate nuclear fusion reactions between deuterium and tritium. Our results suggest that the applicability of continuum models would be greatly enhanced by explicitly including the effects of random fluctuations.},

  abstract = {For optimal processing and design of entangled polymeric materials it is important to establish a rigorous link between the detailed molecular composition of the polymer and the viscoelastic properties of the macroscopic melt. We review current and past computer simulation techniques and critically assess their ability to provide such a link between chemistry and rheology. We distinguish between two classes of coarse-graining levels, which we term coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) and coarse-grained stochastic dynamics (CGSD). In CGMD the coarse-grained beads are still relatively hard, thus automatically preventing bond crossing. This also implies an upper limit on the number of atoms that can be lumped together (up to five backbone carbon atoms) and therefore on the longest chain lengths that can be studied. To reach a higher degree of coarse-graining, in CGSD many more atoms are lumped together (more than ten backbone carbon atoms), leading to relatively soft beads. In that case friction and stochastic forces dominate the interactions, and action must be undertaken to prevent bond crossing. We also review alternative methods that make use of the tube model of polymer dynamics, by obtaining the entanglement characteristics through a primitive path analysis and by simulation of a primitive chain network. We finally review super-coarse-grained methods in which an entire polymer is represented by a single particle, and comment on ways to include memory effects and transient forces.},

  abstract = {A partitioned-domain multiscale method is a computational framework in which certain key regions are modeled atomistically while most of the domain is treated with an approximate continuum model (such as finite elements). The goal of such methods is to be able to reproduce the results of a fully atomistic simulation at a reduced computational cost. In recent years, a large number of partitioned-domain methods have been proposed. Theoretically, these methods appear very different to each other making comparison difficult. Surprisingly, it turns out that at the implementation level these methods are in fact very similar. In this paper, we present a unified framework in which fourteen leading multiscale methods can be represented as special cases. We use this common framework as a platform to test the accuracy and efficiency of the fourteen methods on a test problem; the structure and motion of a Lomer dislocation dipole in face-centered cubic aluminum. This problem was carefully selected to be sufficiently simple to be quick to simulate and straightforward to analyze, but not so simple to unwittingly hide differences between methods. The analysis enables us to identify generic features in multiscale methods that correlate with either high or low accuracy and either fast or slow performance. All tests were performed using a single unified computer code in which all fourteen methods are implemented. This code is being made available to the public along with this paper.},

  abstract = {Despite major scientific, medical and technological advances over the last few decades, a cure for cancer remains elusive. The disease initiation is complex, and including initiation and avascular growth, onset of hypoxia and acidosis due to accumulation of cells beyond normal physiological conditions, inducement of angiogenesis from the surrounding vasculature, tumour vascularization and further growth, and invasion of surrounding tissue and metastasis. Although the focus historically has been to study these events through experimental and clinical observations, mathematical modelling and simulation that enable analysis at multiple time and spatial scales have also complemented these efforts. Here, we provide an overview of this multiscale modelling focusing on the growth phase of tumours and bypassing the initial stage of tumourigenesis. While we briefly review discrete modelling, our focus is on the continuum approach. We limit the scope further by considering models of tumour progression that do not distinguish tumour cells by their age. We also do not consider immune system interactions nor do we describe models of therapy. We do discuss hybrid-modelling frameworks, where the tumour tissue is modelled using both discrete (cell-scale) and continuum (tumour-scale) elements, thus connecting the micrometre to the centimetre tumour scale. We review recent examples that incorporate experimental data into model parameters. We show that recent mathematical modelling predicts that transport limitations of cell nutrients, oxygen and growth factors may result in cell death that leads to morphological instability, providing a mechanism for invasion via tumour fingering and fragmentation. These conditions induce selection pressure for cell survivability, and may lead to additional genetic mutations. Mathematical modelling further shows that parameters that control the tumour mass shape also control its ability to invade. Thus, tumour morphology may serve as a predictor of invasiveness and treatment prognosis.},

  abstract = {This article presents a comprehensive review of numerical methods and models for interface resolving simulations of multiphase flows in microfluidics and micro process engineering. The focus of the paper is on continuum methods where it covers the three common approaches in the sharp interface limit, namely the volume-of-fluid method with interface reconstruction, the level set method and the front tracking method, as well as methods with finite interface thickness such as color-function based methods and the phase-field method. Variants of the mesoscopic lattice Boltzmann method for two-fluid flows are also discussed, as well as various hybrid approaches. The mathematical foundation of each method is given and its specific advantages and limitations are highlighted. For continuum methods, the coupling of the interface evolution equation with the single-field Navier--Stokes equations and related issues are discussed. Methods and models for surface tension forces, contact lines, heat and mass transfer and phase change are presented. In the second part of this article applications of the methods in microfluidics and micro process engineering are reviewed, including flow hydrodynamics (separated and segmented flow, bubble and drop formation, breakup and coalescence), heat and mass transfer (with and without chemical reactions), mixing and dispersion, Marangoni flows and surfactants, and boiling.},

  abstract  = {Helicity is a measure of cork-screw-like motion described by the amount of twisting, writhing, and linking in a fluid. Total helicity is conserved for ideal fluids, but how helicity changes in real fluids with even tiny amounts of viscosity has been an open question. Scheeler et al. provide a complete measurement of total helicity in a real fluid by using a set of hydrofoils to track linking, twisting, and writhing (see the Perspective by Moffatt). They show that twisting dissipates total helicity, whereas writhing and linking conserve it. This provides a fundamental insight into tornadogenesis, atmospheric flows, and the formation of turbulence.Science, this issue p. 487; see also p. 448Helicity, a topological measure of the intertwining of vortices in a fluid flow, is a conserved quantity in inviscid fluids but can be dissipated by viscosity in real flows. Despite its relevance across a range of flows, helicity in real fluids remains poorly understood because the entire quantity is challenging to measure. We measured the total helicity of thin-core vortex tubes in water. For helical vortices that are stretched or compressed by a second vortex, we found conservation of total helicity. For an isolated helical vortex, we observed evolution toward and maintenance of a constant helicity state after the dissipation of twist helicity by viscosity. Our results show that helicity can remain constant even in a viscous fluid and provide an improved basis for understanding and manipulating helicity in real flows.},

  abstract  = {Energy in a turbulent system moves from large eddies to smaller ones until it is dissipated by viscous motion. The details of exactly how this works have remained obscure, in part because of the challenge of simulating fluids across many length scales in three dimensions over time. Cardesa et al. present a large numeric simulation of a water-like fluid that shows characteristic length scales for the birth and death of turbulent whirls. The approach can be extended to understand energy transfer in the atmosphere, plasmas, and other complex systems.Science, this issue p. 782To the naked eye, turbulent flows exhibit whirls of many different sizes. To each size, or scale, corresponds a fraction of the total energy resulting from a cascade in five dimensions: scale, time, and three-dimensional space. Understanding this process is critical to strategies for modeling geophysical and industrial flows. By tracking the flow regions containing energy in different scales, we have detected the statistical predominance of a cross-scale link whereby fluid lumps of energy at scale Δ appear within lumps of scale 2Δ and die within those of scale Δ/2. Our approach uncovers the energy cascade in a simple water-like fluid, offering insights for turbulence models while paving the way for similar analyses in conducting fluids, quantum fluids, and plasmas.},

  abstract = { An active fluid denotes a viscous suspension of particles, cells, or macromolecules able to convert chemical energy into mechanical work by generating stresses on the microscale. By virtue of this internal energy conversion, these systems display unusual macroscopic rheological signatures, including a curious transition to an apparent superfluid-like state where internal activity exactly compensates viscous dissipation. These behaviors are unlike those of classical complex fluids and result from the coupling of particle configurations with both externally applied flows and internally generated fluid disturbances. Focusing on the well-studied example of a suspension of microswimmers, this review summarizes recent experiments, models, and simulations in this area and highlights the critical role played by the rheological response of these active materials in a multitude of phenomena, from the enhanced transport of passive suspended objects to the emergence of spontaneous flows and collective motion. },

Applications include the detection of pathological changes to red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets at unparalleled sensitivity and the efficacy assessment of drug treatment. Recent efforts have aimed at the development of microfluidics-based tests usable in a clinial environment or the replication of more complex diseases such as thrombosis. These microfluidic disease models enable the study of onset and progression of disease as well as the identification of key players and risk factors, which have led to a spectrum of clinically relevant findings. },

  abstract = { Microrheological study of complex fluids traces its roots to the work of the botanist Robert Brown in the early nineteenth century. Indeed, passive microrheology and Brownian motion are one and the same. Once thought to reveal a fundamental life force, the phenomenon was ultimately leveraged by Einstein in proof of the atomic nature of matter (Haw 2006). His work simultaneously paved the way for modern-day passive microrheology by connecting observable particle motion—diffusion—to solvent properties—the viscosity—via the well-known Stokes–Einstein relation. Advances in microscopy techniques in the last two decades have prompted extensions of the original model to generalized forms for passive probing of complex fluids. In the last decade, active microrheology has emerged as a means by which to interrogate the nonequilibrium behavior of complex fluids, in particular, the non-Newtonian rheology of dynamically heterogeneous and microscopically small systems. Here we review theoretical and computational approaches and advances in both passive and active microrheology, with a focus on the extent to which these techniques preserve the connection between single-particle motion and flow properties, as well as the rather surprising recovery of non-Newtonian flow behavior observed in bulk rheology. },

The advantages and limitations of various models are discussed, with a focus on common features rather than differences. Several avenues for further progress are suggested. },

  abstract = { Simulation of compressible flows became a routine activity with the appearance of shock-/contact-capturing methods. These methods can determine all waves, particularly discontinuous ones. However, additional difficulties may appear in two-phase and multimaterial flows due to the abrupt variation of thermodynamic properties across the interfacial region, with discontinuous thermodynamical representations at the interfaces. To overcome this difficulty, researchers have developed augmented systems of governing equations to extend the capturing strategy. These extended systems, reviewed here, are termed diffuse-interface models, because they are designed to compute flow variables correctly in numerically diffused zones surrounding interfaces. In particular, they facilitate coupling the dynamics on both sides of the (diffuse) interfaces and tend to the proper pure fluid–governing equations far from the interfaces. This strategy has become efficient for contact interfaces separating fluids that are governed by different equations of state, in the presence or absence of capillary effects, and with phase change. More sophisticated materials than fluids (e.g., elastic–plastic materials) have been considered as well. },

  abstract = { The understanding of hydrodynamic forces around particles, drops, or bubbles moving in Newtonian liquids is modestly mature. It is possible to obtain predictions of the attractive–repulsive interaction for moving ensembles of dispersed particulate objects. There is a certain intuition of what the effects of viscous, inertial, and surface tension forces should be. When the liquid is non-Newtonian, this intuition is gone. In this review, we summarize recent efforts at gaining fundamental understanding of hydrodynamic interactions in non-Newtonian liquids. Due to the complexity of the problem, most investigations rely on experimental observations. However, computations of non-Newtonian fluid flow have made increasingly significant contributions to our understanding of particle, drop, and bubble interactions. We focus on gravity-driven flows: rise or sedimentation of single spheroidal objects, pairs, and dispersions. We identify the effects of two main rheological attributes—viscoelasticity and shear-dependent viscosity—on the interaction and potential aggregation of particles, drops, and bubbles. We end by highlighting the open questions in the subject and by suggesting future directions toward the fundamental physics as well as applications. },

  abstract = { Granular materials composed of particles with differing grain sizes, densities, shapes, or surface properties may experience unexpected segregation during flow. This review focuses on kinetic sieving and squeeze expulsion, whose combined effect produces the dominant gravity-driven segregation mechanism in dense sheared flows. Shallow granular avalanches that form at the surface of more complex industrial flows such as heaps, silos, and rotating drums provide ideal conditions for particles to separate, with large particles rising to the surface and small particles percolating down to the base. When this is combined with erosion and deposition, amazing patterns can form in the underlying substrate. Gravity-driven segregation and velocity shear induce differential lateral transport, which may be thought of as a secondary segregation mechanism. This allows larger particles to accumulate at flow fronts, and if they are more frictional than the fine grains, they can feedback on the bulk flow, causing flow fingering, levee formation, and longer runout of geophysical mass flows. },

The interactions can arise from hydrodynamic disturbances, giving multibody interactions at long ranges and pairwise lubrication forces over short distances. For concentrated suspensions, additional interactions due to excluded volume (contacts) and adhesive forces are addressed.

  abstract = {Cell membranes are vital to shield a cellâs interior from the environment. At the same time they determine to a large extent the cellâs mechanical resistance to external forces. In recent years there has been considerable interest in the accurate computational modeling of such membranes, driven mainly by the amazing variety of shapes that red blood cells and model systems such as vesicles can assume in external flows. Given that the typical height of a membrane is only a few nanometers while the surface of the cell extends over many micrometers, physical modeling approaches mostly consider the interface as a two-dimensional elastic continuum. Here we review recent modeling efforts focusing on one of the computationally most intricate components, namely the membraneâs bending resistance. We start with a short background on the most widely used bending model due to Helfrich. While the Helfrich bending energy by itself is an extremely simple model equation, the computation of the resulting forces is far from trivial. At the heart of these difficulties lies the fact that the forces involve second order derivatives of the local surface curvature which by itself is the second derivative of the membrane geometry. We systematically derive and compare the different routes to obtain bending forces from the Helfrich energy, namely the variational approach and the thin-shell theory. While both routes lead to mathematically identical expressions, so-called linear bending models are shown to reproduce only the leading order term while higher orders differ. The main part of the review contains a description of various computational strategies which we classify into three categories: the force , the strong and the weak formulation. We finally give some examples for the application of these strategies in actual simulations.},

We discuss flow of the blood formed elements [red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells or leukocytes (WBCs) and platelets] in individual arterioles, capillaries, and venules, and in microvascular networks. We also review mechanical and rheological properties of the formed elements and their interactions with the vascular wall. We discuss short-term and long-term regulation of the microvasculature; the modes of regulation include metabolic, myogenic, and shear-stress-dependent mechanisms as well as vascular adaptation such as angiogenesis and vascular remodeling. },

  abstract = {Microfluidic tools are providing many new insights into the chemical, physical and physicochemical responses of cells. Both suspension-level and single-cell measurements have been studied. We review our studies of these kinds of problems for red blood cells with particular focus on the shapes of individual cells in confined geometries, the development and use of a 'differential manometer' for evaluating the mechanical response of individual cells or other objects flowing in confined geometries, and the cross-streamline drift of cells that pass through a constriction. In particular, we show how fluid mechanical effects on suspended cells can be studied systematically in small devices, and how these features can be exploited to develop methods for characterizing physicochemical responses and possibly for the diagnosis of cellular-scale changes to environmental factors.},

Monolayer stretching during a shape change of the vesicle affects the spontaneous curvature of the membrane but, if measured values of material parameters are inserted in the equations, it turns out to be a minor perturbation. They also treat the budding of infinitely extended flat membranes where the spontaneous curvature is strictly constant during the deformation. The calculated shapes are compared to photographed buds in very large phosphatidylcholine membranes.},

Shape transitions are investigated both in simple shear flows and in cylindrical capillary flows. We focus on reduced volumes, where the discocyte shape of fluid vesicles is stable, and the prolate shape is metastable. In simple shear flow at low membrane viscosity, the shear induces a transformation from discocyte to prolate with increasing shear rate, while at high membrane viscosity, the shear induces a transformation from prolate to discocyte, or tumbling motion accompanied by oscillations between these two morphologies. In capillary flow, at small flow velocities the symmetry axis of the discocyte is found not to be oriented perpendicular to the cylinder axis. With increasing flow velocity, a transition to a prolate shape occurs for fluid vesicles, while vesicles with shear-elastic membranes (like red blood cells) transform into a coaxial parachute-like shape.},

  abstract  = {Light scattering is a well-established experimental technique, which gains more and more popularity in the biological field because it offers the means for non-invasive imaging and detection. However, the interpretation of light-scattering signals remains challenging due to the complexity of most biological systems. Here, we investigate static and dynamic scattering properties of red blood cells (RBCs) using two mesoscopic hydrodynamics simulation methods—multi-particle collision dynamics and dissipative particle dynamics. Light scattering is studied for various membrane shear elasticities, bending rigidities, and RBC shapes (e.g., biconcave and stomatocyte). Simulation results from the two simulation methods show good agreement, and demonstrate that the static light scattering of a diffusing RBC is not very sensitive to the changes in membrane properties and moderate alterations in cell shapes. We also compute dynamic light scattering of a diffusing RBC, from which dynamic properties of RBCs such as diffusion coefficients can be accessed. In contrast to static light scattering, the dynamic measurements can be employed to differentiate between the biconcave and stomatocytic RBC shapes and generally allow the differentiation based on the membrane properties. Our simulation results can be used for better understanding of light scattering by RBCs and the development of new non-invasive methods for blood-flow monitoring.},

  abstract = { Interior surfaces of capillaries are lined with macromolecules forming an endothelial surface layer (ESL). A theoretical model is used to investigate effects of flow velocity on motion and axisymmetric deformation of red blood cells in a capillary with an ESL. Cell deformation is analyzed, including effects of membrane shear and bending elasticity. Plasma flow around the cell and through the ESL is computed using lubrication theory. The ESL is represented as a porous layer that exerts compressive forces on red blood cells that penetrate it. According to the model, hydrodynamic pressures generated by plasma flow around the cell squeeze moving red blood cells into narrow elongated shapes. If the ESL is 0.7 μm wide, with hydraulic resistivity of 2 × 108dyn · s · cm−4, and exerts a force of 20 dyn/cm2, predicted variation with flow velocity of the gap width between red blood cell and capillary wall agrees well with observations. Predicted gap at a velocity of 0.1 mm/s is ∼0.6 μm vs. ∼0.2 μm with no ESL. Predicted flow resistance increases markedly at low velocities. The model shows that exclusion of red blood cells from the ESL in flowing capillaries can result from hydrodynamic forces generated by plasma flow through the ESL. },

The paper extends earlier analytical findings of Ripoll, M., Ernst, M. H., and Espa˜nol, P. (Large scale and mesoscopic hydrodynamics for dissipative particle dynamics. Journal of Chemical Physics, 115(15), 7271--7281 (2001)) by evaluation of numerical data for the particle and collective scaling regimes and the four different subregimes. DPD simulations are performed for a range of dynamic overlapping parameters. Based on analyses of the current auto-correlation functions (CACFs), we demonstrate that within the particle regime at scales smaller than its force cut-off radius, DPD follows Langevin dynamics. For the collective regime, we show that the small-scale behavior of DPD differs from Langevin dynamics. For the wavenumber-dependent effective shear viscosity, universal scaling regimes are observed in the microscopic and mesoscopic wavenumber ranges over the considered range of dynamic overlapping parameters.},

Thermal fluctuations have a dramatic effect on the conformation and elastic properties of membranes. We describe in this review both the continuum models of membranes which are used for theoretical analyses as well as the network models employed in simulations. The fruitful interaction between these two approaches, which has lead to recent progress in this field, is emphasized. We summarize the essential results of recent research on fluctuating membranes; in particular, the effects of bending rigidity, self-avoidance, attractive interactions, disorder, topological defects and external compression forces are discussed in detail.},

  abstract = {A procedure is developed to calculate red blood cell and phospholipid vesicle shapes within the bilayer couple model of the membrane. The membrane is assumed to consist of two laterally incompressible leaflets which are in close contact but unconnected. Shapes are determined by minimizing the membrane bending energy at a given volume of a cell (V), given average membrane area (A) and given difference of the areas of two leaflets ($\Delta$A). Different classes of shapes exist in parts of the v/$\Delta$a phase diagram, where v and $\Delta$a are the volume and the leaflet area difference relative to the sphere with area A. The limiting shapes are composed of sections of spheres with only two values allowed for their radii. Two low energy axisymmetrical classes, which include discocyte and stomatocyte shapes are studied and their phase diagrams are analyzed. For v=0.6, the discocyte is the lowest energy shape, which transforms by decreasing $\Delta$a continuously into a stomatocyte. The spontaneous membrane curvature (C0) and compressibility of membrane leaflest can be incorporated into the model.},

  abstract = {Biological membranes are examples of 'smart' materials whose properties and behaviour emerge from the propagation across many scales of the molecular characteristics of their constituents. Artificial smart materials, such as drug delivery vehicles and biosensors, often rely on modifying naturally occurring soft matter, such as polymers and lipid vesicles, so that they possess useful behaviour. However, the complexity of natural membranes, both in their static properties, exemplified in their phase behaviour, and in their dynamic properties, as in the kinetics of their formation and interactions, hinders their rational modification. Mesoscopic simulations, such as dissipative particle dynamics (DPD), allow in silico experiments to be easily and cheaply performed on complex, soft materials requiring as input only the molecular structure of the constituents at a coarse-grained level. They can therefore act as a guide to experimenters prior to performing costly assays. Additionally, mesoscopic simulations provide the only currently feasible window on the length- and timescales relevant to important biophysical processes such as vesicle fusion. We review here the development of computational models of bilayer membranes, and in particular the use of mesoscopic simulations to follow the molecular rearrangements that occur during membrane fusion.},

  abstract = {Stretching red blood cells using optical tweezers is a way to characterize the mechanical properties of their membrane by measuring the size of the cell in the direction of the stretching (axial diameter) and perpendicularly (transverse diameter). Recently, such data have been used in numerous publications to validate solvers dedicated to the computation of red blood cell dynamics under flow. In the present study, different mechanical models are used to simulate the stretching of red blood cells by optical tweezers. Results first show that the mechanical moduli of the membranes have to be adjusted as a function of the model used. In addition, by assessing the area dilation of the cells, the axial and transverse diameters measured in optical tweezers experiments are found to be insufficient to discriminate between models relevant to red blood cells or not. At last, it is shown that other quantities such as the height or the profile of the cell should be preferred for validation purposes since they are more sensitive to the membrane model.},

  abstract = {Red blood cells (RBCs) deform significantly and repeatedly when passing through narrow capillaries and delivering dioxygen throughout the body. Deformability of RBCs is a key characteristic, largely governed by the mechanical properties of the cell membrane. This study investigated RBC mechanical properties using atomic force microscopy (AFM) with the aim to develop a coarse-grained particle method model to study for the first time RBC indentation in both 2D and 3D. This new model has the potential to be applied to further investigate the local deformability of RBCs, with accurate control over adhesion, probe geometry and position of applied force.},

  abstract  = {The 3D opening of the interendothelial slit in human spleen creates a physical fitness test for red blood cells (RBCs) and clears them from circulation if their geometry and deformability are altered. We present a unique computational framework for the development of prognostic markers for diseases that alter RBC physical characteristics and identify quantitative limits for splenic slit clearance. Our work shows how the splenic slit determines distributions of size and shape of healthy RBCs. Our work lays the groundwork for systematic reconstruction of RBC navigation in the human spleen with consequences for a variety of acute and chronic medical conditions associated with hereditary alterations of RBCs, infectious diseases, and cancers.Red blood cells (RBCs) can be cleared from circulation when alterations in their size, shape, and deformability are detected. This function is modulated by the spleen-specific structure of the interendothelial slit (IES). Here, we present a unique physiological framework for development of prognostic markers in RBC diseases by quantifying biophysical limits for RBCs to pass through the IES, using computational simulations based on dissipative particle dynamics. The results show that the spleen selects RBCs for continued circulation based on their geometry, consistent with prior in vivo observations. A companion analysis provides critical bounds relating surface area and volume for healthy RBCs beyond which the RBCs fail the {\textquotedblleft}physical fitness test{\textquotedblright} to pass through the IES, supporting independent experiments. Our results suggest that the spleen plays an important role in determining distributions of size and shape of healthy RBCs. Because mechanical retention of infected RBC impacts malaria pathogenesis, we studied key biophysical parameters for RBCs infected with Plasmodium falciparum as they cross the IES. In agreement with experimental results, surface area loss of an infected RBC is found to be a more important determinant of splenic retention than its membrane stiffness. The simulations provide insights into the effects of pressure gradient across the IES on RBC retention. By providing quantitative biophysical limits for RBCs to pass through the IES, the narrowest circulatory bottleneck in the spleen, our results offer a broad approach for developing quantitative markers for diseases such as hereditary spherocytosis, thalassemia, and malaria.},

Aside from the mean and Gaussian curvatures, this free-energy density involves a spontaneous mean-curvature that encompasses information regarding the preferred, natural shape of the lipid bilayer. We use a straightforward microphysical argument to derive the Canham--Helfrich free-energy density. Our derivation (1) provides a justification for the common assertion that spontaneous curvature originates primarily from asymmetry between the leaflets comprising a bilayer and (2) furnishes expressions for the splay and saddle-splay moduli in terms of derivatives of the underlying potential.},

Vesicle size, surface charge, or permeability can be readily adjusted by varying the ratio of anionic to cationic surfactant. Vesicle formation apparently results from the production of anion-cation surfactant pairs that then act as double-tailed zwitterionic surfactants. These vesicles are quite stable in comparison to conventional vesicles prepared by mechanical disruption of insoluble liquid crystalline dispersions.},

  abstract = {Research on giant vesicles is becoming increasingly popular. Giant vesicles provide model biomembrane systems for systematic measurements of mechanical and rheological properties of bilayers as a function of membrane composition and temperature, as well as hydrodynamic interactions. Membrane response to external factors (for example electric fields, ions and amphiphilic molecules) can be directly visualized under the microscope. In this paper we review our current understanding of lipid bilayers as obtained from studies on giant unilamellar vesicles. Because research on giant vesicles increasingly attracts the interest of scientists from various backgrounds, we also try to provide a concise introduction for newcomers in the field. Finally, we summarize some recent developments on curvature effects induced by polymers, domain formation in membranes and shape transitions induced by electric fields.},

In the presence of gravity, these vesicles sink to the bottom of the container, and eventually adhere even on non-attractive substrates. The strong size dependence of the gravitational energy makes large parts of the phase diagram accessible to experiments even for small density differences. For relatively large volume, non-axisymmetric bound shapes are explicitly calculated and shown to be stable. Osmotic deflation of such a vesicle leads back to axisymmetric shapes and, finally, to a collapsed state of the vesicle.},

In particular{,} we show how topological defects{,} necessarily present in any crystalline lattice confined to spherical topology{,} naturally lead to the formation of icosahedra in a homogeneous elastic vesicle. Furthermore{,} we show that introducing heterogeneities in the elastic properties{,} or allowing for non-linear bending response of a homogeneous system{,} opens non-trivial pathways to the formation of faceted{,} yet non-icosahedral{,} structures.},

  abstract  = {We have used a microfluidic mass sensor to measure the density of single living cells. By weighing each cell in two fluids of different densities, our technique measures the single-cell mass, volume, and density of approximately 500 cells per hour with a density precision of 0.001~g~mL-1. We observe that the intrinsic cell-to-cell variation in density is nearly 100-fold smaller than the mass or volume variation. As a result, we can measure changes in cell density indicative of cellular processes that would be otherwise undetectable by mass or volume measurements. Here, we demonstrate this with four examples: identifying Plasmodium falciparum malaria-infected erythrocytes in a culture, distinguishing transfused blood cells from a patient{\textquoteright}s own blood, identifying irreversibly sickled cells in a sickle cell patient, and identifying leukemia cells in the early stages of responding to a drug treatment. These demonstrations suggest that the ability to measure single-cell density will provide valuable insights into cell state for a wide range of biological processes.},

  abstract = {Bilayer membranes are intrinsically fluid in character and require stabilization by association with an underlying cytoskeleton. Instability either in the membrane-associated cytoskeleton or in the association between the bilayer and the skeleton can lead to loss of membrane bilayer and premature cell death. In this report measurements of the physical strength of the association between membrane bilayer and the membrane-associated skeleton in red blood cells are reported. These measurements involve the mechanical formation of long, thin cylinders of membrane bilayer (tethers) from the red cell surface. ultrastructural evidence is presented indicating that these tethers do not contain membrane skeleton and, furthermore, that they are deficient in at least some integral membrane proteins. By measuring the forces on the cell as the tether is formed and the dimensions of the tether, the energy associated with its formation can be calculated. The minimum force to form a tether was found to be ≈50 pN corresponding to an energy of dissociation of 0.2--0.3 mJ/m2. Such measurements enable critical evaluation of potential physical mechanisms for the stabilization of the membrane bilayer by the underlying cytoskeleton. It is postulated that an important contribution to the energy of association between bilayer and skeleton comes from the increase in chemical potential due to the lateral segregation of lipids and integral proteins.},

We discuss some of the important extensions of the DDM in the fields of multiscale modeling for soft materials such as simple and complex fluids. To this end, we typically model the fluids in two or more levels of detail, which exploits the computational efficiency of the coarse model and physical accuracy of the fine description. For simple fluids, we take a continuum perspective to couple the molecular dynamics (MD) and Navier-Stokes equations by matching the state variables and/or fluxes across the hybrid interface. For complex fluids, we take a discrete perspective to encompass the complex structure of the molecules and couple the MD with coarse-grained MD by interpolating the forces between the two levels of descriptions.},

The BLV exhibits a non-Newtonian behavior with a time-dependent apparent viscosity during its unsteady motion.

Three major elements constitute the basis for the proposed method: (1) pulling the cell membrane by increasing the adhesion of the tip to the cell surface provided via appropriate tip modification; (2) measuring force-distance curves with emphasis on selecting the appropriate withdrawal regions for analysis; (3) fitting of the theoretical model for axisymmetric bending of an annular thick plate to the experimental curve in the withdrawal region, prior to the detachment point of the tip from the cell membrane. This approach, applied to human erythrocytes, suggests a complimentary technique to the commonly used methods.

  abstract = { The simulation of biological membranes over length and time scales relevant to cellular biology is not currently feasible using conventional (fully atomic or molecularly detailed) simulation strategies. Given the wide disparity between what is possible on today's computers and the problems one might like to study, it seems unlikely this situation will change for several decades. An appealing alternative to traditional computational approaches is to employ simpler, continuum-based models developed within the frameworks of elasticity theory, fluid dynamics, and statistical mechanics. Although such models have seen wide use in analytical descriptions of membrane behavior, the extension of these methods to more general situations and numerical analysis is just beginning to be explored. This article reviews continuum models for membrane behavior with an emphasis on the use of such models in computational studies. Two applications are explored to demonstrate the utility of this level of coarse-grained modeling. },

Our results suggest that any pathological change in RBCs{\textquoteright} local rheology will impact the onset of these morphological transitions and should play a key role in pathological blood flow.Blood viscosity decreases with shear stress, a property essential for an efficient perfusion of the vascular tree. Shear thinning is intimately related to the dynamics and mutual interactions of RBCs, the major component of blood. Because of the lack of knowledge about the behavior of RBCs under physiological conditions, the link between RBC dynamics and blood rheology remains unsettled. We performed experiments and simulations in microcirculatory flow conditions of viscosity, shear rates, and volume fractions, and our study reveals rich RBC dynamics that govern shear thinning. In contrast to the current paradigm, which assumes that RBCs align steadily around the flow direction while their membranes and cytoplasm circulate, we show that RBCs successively tumble, roll, deform into rolling stomatocytes, and, finally, adopt highly deformed polylobed shapes for increasing shear stresses, even for semidilute volume fractions of the microcirculation. Our results suggest that any pathological change in plasma composition, RBC cytosol viscosity, or membrane mechanical properties will affect the onset of these morphological transitions and should play a central role in pathological blood rheology and flow behavior.},

A general solution to this problem is to calculate the bending energy of an arbitrarily shaped membrane surface{,} which can include both lipids and cytoskeletal proteins{,} and minimize the energy subject to all mechanical constraints. However{,} the calculations are difficult to perform{,} especially for shapes that do not possess axial symmetry. We show that the spherical harmonics parameterization (SHP) provides an analytic description of shape that can be used to quickly and reliably calculate minimum energy shapes of both symmetric and asymmetric surfaces. Using this method{,} we probe the entire set of shapes predicted by the bilayer couple model{,} unifying work based on different computational approaches{,} and providing additional details of the transitions between different shape classes. In addition{,} we present new minimum-energy morphologies based on non-linear models of membrane skeletal elasticity that closely mimic extreme shapes of red blood cells. The SHP thus provides a versatile shape description that can be used to investigate forces that shape cells.},

  abstract = {Over millions of years, Nature has optimized the motion of biological systems at the micro and nanoscales. Motor proteins to motile single cells have managed to overcome Brownian motion and solve several challenges that arise at low Reynolds numbers. In this review, we will briefly describe naturally motile systems and their strategies to move, starting with a general introduction that surveys a broad range of developments, followed by an overview about the physical laws and parameters that govern and limit motion at the micro scale. We characterize some of the classes of biological microswimmers that have arisen in the course of evolution, as well as the hybrid structures that have been constructed based on these, ranging from Montemagno’s ATPase motor to the SpermBot. Thereafter, we maintain our focus on bacteria and their biohybrids. We introduce the inherent properties of bacteria as a natural microswimmer and explain the different principles bacteria use for their motion. We then elucidate different strategies that have been employed for the coupling of a variety of artificial micro-objects to the bacterial surface, and evaluate the different effects the coupled objects have on the motion of the “biohybrid”. Concluding, we give a short overview and a realistic evaluation of proposed applications in the field.

The shape of the deformed shells depends on the deformation rate, the reduced volume V / V 0 and the Föppl–von Kármán number γ. For slow deformations the shell attains its ground state, a shell with a single indentation, whereas for large deformation rates the shell appears crumpled with many indentations. The rim of the single indentation undergoes a shape transition from smooth to polygonal for γ ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/sime.gif] {sime} 7000(Δ V / V 0 ) − 3/4 . For the smooth rim the elastic energy scales like γ 1/4 whereas for the polygonal indentation we find a much smaller exponent, even smaller than the exponent 1/6 that is predicted for stretching ridges. The relaxation of a shell with multiple indentations towards the ground state follows an Ostwald ripening type of pathway and depends on the compression rate and on the Föppl–von Kármán number. The number of indentations decreases as a power law with time t following N ind ~ t − 0.375 for γ=8×10 3 and γ=8×10 4 whereas for γ=8×10 5 the relaxation time is longer than the simulation time.},

Reynolds numbers are much less than 1, and the equations of Stokes flow apply. Blood is a suspension of cells with dimensions comparable to microvessel diameters. Highly deformable red blood cells, which transport oxygen, have a volume concentration (hematocrit) of 40–45\% in humans. In the narrowest capillaries, these cells move in single file with a surrounding lubricating layer of plasma. In larger vessels, the red blood cells migrate toward the centerline, reducing the resistance to blood flow. Vessel walls are coated with a layer of macromolecules that restricts flow. At diverging bifurcations, hematocrit is not evenly distributed in the downstream vessels. Other particles are driven toward the walls by interactions with red blood cells. These physiologically important phenomena are discussed here from a fluid mechanical perspective. },

  abstract = {We propose a new algorithm for the computation of Willmore flow. This is the L2-gradient flow for the Willmore functional, which is the classical bending energy of a surface. Willmore flow is described by a highly nonlinear system of PDEs of fourth order for the parametrization of the surface. The spatially discrete numerical scheme is stable and consistent. The discretization relies on an adequate calculation of the first variation of the Willmore functional together with a derivation of the second variation of the area functional which is well adapted to discretization techniques with finite elements. The algorithm uses finite elements on surfaces. We give numerical examples and tests for piecewise linear finite elements. A convergence proof for the full algorithm remains an open question.},
